::: callout-note
You are reading **Tidy Finance with R**. You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with Python** [here](../python/other-data-providers.qmd). 
:::

In the previous chapters, we introduced many ways to get financial data that researchers regularly use. We showed how to load data into R from Yahoo Finance and commonly used file types, such as comma-separated or Excel files. Then, we introduced remotely connecting to WRDS and downloading data from there. However, this is only a subset of the vast amounts of data available these days.

In this short chapter, we aim to provide an overview of common alternative data providers for which direct access via R packages exists. Such a list requires constant adjustments because both data providers and access methods change. However, we want to emphasize two main insights: First, the number of R packages that provide access to (financial) data is large. Too large actually to survey here exhaustively. Instead, we can only cover the tip of the iceberg. Second, R provides the functionalities to access basically any form of files or data available online. Thus, even if a desired data source does not come with a well-established R package, chances are high that data can be retrieved by establishing your own API connection or by scrapping the content.

In our non-exhaustive list below, we restrict ourselves to listing data sources accessed through easy-to-use R packages. For further inspiration on potential data sources, we recommend reading the [R task view empirical finance.](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Finance.html) Further inspiration (on more general social sciences) can be found [here.](https://cengel.github.io/gearup2016/SULdataAccess.html)

Apart from the list below, we want to advertise some amazing data compiled by others. First, there is [Open Source Asset Pricing](https://www.openassetpricing.com/data) related to @Chen2022. They provide return data for over 200 trading strategies with different time periods and specifications. The authors also provide signals and explanations of the factor construction. Moreover, in the same spirit, [Global factor data](https://www.jkpfactors.com) provides the data related to Jensen2022b. They provide return data for characteristic-managed portfolios from around the world. The database includes factors for 153 characteristics in 13 themes, using data from 93 countries.

## Exercises

1. Select one of the data sources in the table above and retrieve some data. Browse the homepage of the data provider or the package documentation to find inspiration on which type of data is available to you and how to download the data into your R session.
2. Generate summary statistics of the data you retrieved and provide some useful visualization. The possibilities are endless: Maybe there is some interesting economic event you want to analyze, such as stock market responses to Twitter activity.
