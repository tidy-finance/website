In this blog post, we show how to obtain and analyze shareholder proposal voting data for publicly listed firms in the US. For context, the SEC allows shareholders to submit proposals a few months before the annual general meeting (AGM), and these proposals end up on the ballot and are voted on (1) if a firm's management does not submit a 'no-action request' accepted by the SEC or (2) management and shareholders do not reach an agreement prior to the AGM. Voting outcomes are non-binding, but management usually experiences pressure from organizations such as the Council of Institutional Investors (CII) if they do not adequately act on a proposal's voting outcome [@bachmetzger2017]. We refer to data provided by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), which gained popularity as one of the major US proxy advisors. A proxy advisor provides recommendations to institutional investors on how to vote on proposals at AGMs, and in this context, ISS has used its advantageous position to build an extensive database that collects information on management and shareholder proposals.

Our code relies on the following R packages.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyfinance)
library(RSQLite)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
```


# Data Preparation

We start by establishing a connection to WRDS using the `tidyfinance` package (you can find more information [here](https://www.tidy-finance.org/r/wrds-crsp-and-compustat.html#accessing-wrds)) as we query the data directly through their servers. We also load stocks' identifying information to match ISS identifiers (8-digit CUSIP) with CRSP PERMNOs. Finally, we read in an Excel file containing granular ESG-type categorization of proposal types, which is separately provided by ISS.

```{r}
wrds <- get_wrds_connection()
```


## Fetching Shareholder Proposals

ISS provides two main datasets that contain shareholder proposals related to publicly listed US firms: 
* ISS Voting Analytics - Shareholder Proposals
* ISS Voting Analytics - Company Vote Results US 

The Shareholder Proposals table contains all shareholder proposals that were submitted to the SEC, regardless of whether they eventually came to a vote at the AGM (sample coverage: 2006 - 2024). The Company Vote Results table, on the other hand, has all proposals that made it to the ballot at AGM and hence also includes management proposals (sample coverage: 2002 - 2024).[^1][^2] We decide to use the Company Vote Results data as we are primarily interested in proposals that shareholders actually voted on and exploit the slightly longer sample period. We extract company names and identifiers, meeting dates, vote shares, and short descriptions of proposal contents.

[^1]: A typical example of a management proposal is the election of new board members.
[^2]: Upon request, ISS also provides legacy data going back until 1997.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- tbl(wrds, I("iss_va_vote_us.vavoteresults")) |> 
  select(cusip, companyid, name, ticker,
         meetingdate, recorddate, meetingid,
         sponsor, itemonagendaid, issagendaitemid,
         agendageneraldesc, itemdesc,
         outstandingshare, voterequirement, base,
         votedabstain, votedagainst, votedfor, votedwithheld,
         voteresult) |>
  collect()
```

In order to filter for proposals submitted by shareholders, we refer to the variable `sponsor` and keep the sponsor type denoted as `"Shareholder"`.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  filter(sponsor == "Shareholder")
```


## Add Variables on Vote Outcomes

As we are dealing with shareholder proposal voting data, our main interest is, of course, the voting outcome, which we determine by computing vote shares. Firms define voting rules in their corporate charters, and the variable `base` informs us about the voting rule that applies to a specific observation in our sample. One primarily distinguishes two cases: either abstentions are counted as votes against the proposal (`base == "F+A+AB"`), or they are simply ignored (`base == "F+A"`). We need to be careful with the values in `base` since the voting rules are spelled inconsistently. Two additional, though unpopular, voting categories need to be accounted for: `"Outstanding"` and `"Capital Represe"`. These require dividing the votes in favor of the proposals by the total number of shares outstanding.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(vshr = case_when(base %in% c("F+A", "F A") ~ votedfor / (votedfor + votedagainst),
                          base %in% c("F+A+AB", "F A AB") ~ votedfor / (votedfor + votedagainst + votedabstain),
                          base %in% c("Outstanding", "Capital Represe") ~ votedfor / outstandingshare,
                          .default = NA))
```

As pointed out by @cunatetal2020, early studies mainly used a so-called simple majority rule, which translates into dividing votes in favor of the proposals by votes against the proposal. The reason is that earlier versions of the ISS database did not contain specific information on the voting rules defined in corporate charters but only provided votes in favor versus votes against a proposal. To be able to replicate prior results, we add a variable that computes the simple voting rule, which will collapse to the sophisticated voting rule if firms use `votedfor` / `votedagainst` (i.e., `base == "F+A"`). Next, we determine whether a proposal passed by comparing the vote share with the vote requirement.[^3] If the vote share exceeds the vote requirement, we assign a value equal to one and zero otherwise.

[^3]: Typically, the vote requirement equals 50\%. Note, however, that there are also exceptions, e.g., when shareholders elect new board members. This is often a pro forma vote with a minuscule threshold.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(vshr_simple = votedfor / (votedfor + votedagainst))
  
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(pass = if_else(vshr >= voterequirement, 1, 0),
         pass_simple = if_else(vshr_simple >= voterequirement, 1, 0))
```

We also compute the absolute distance of the vote share to the majority threshold.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(dist_trhd = abs(voterequirement - vshr),
         dist_trhd_simple = abs(voterequirement - vshr_simple))
```

To ensure there are no inconsistencies between our computations of vote shares and ISS' assessment of proposal passage, we check whether our pass dummies agree with those of ISS. We conclude that this is the case for all proposals in the sample at hand. We also make sure to exclude proposal for which we are unable to properly compute vote shares and those that have a missing ISS assessment on whether the proposal passed or failed. 

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(pass_iss_agree = if_else((pass == 1 & voteresult == "Pass") | (pass == 0 & voteresult == "Fail"), 1, 0),
         pass_simple_iss_agree = if_else((pass_simple == 1 & voteresult == "Pass") | (pass_simple == 0 & voteresult == "Fail"), 1, 0)) |>
  filter(voteresult == "Pass" | voteresult == "Fail",
         !is.na(vshr) | !is.na(vshr_simple))
```

We detected a few obvious data errors, which we account for by applying some additional cleaning steps. We require that proposals must have received at least one vote, no matter whether for or against, and that `base` is unequal to `Votes Represent` because we are not sure what this voting rule refers to.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  filter(votedfor + votedagainst > 0) |>
  filter(base != "Votes Represent")
```

# Proposal Classification

For most analyses, we want to know the reason for the proposal's submission, or more precisely, what is actually voted on at AGMs. For that matter, ISS divides proposals into two resolution types, governance (GOV) and socially responsible investing (SRI), but also provides a more detailed categorization within GOV and SRI (see variable `issagendaitemid`). We refer to this more granular categorization and additionally rely on @heetal2023, who check and classify proposals manually to ensure we correctly capture proposals that are related to the issues we would like to analyze. ISS separately provides broad ESG-type classifications that can be linked to `issagendaitemid`. The respective Excel file containing the ESG classifications can be downloaded from [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/1972/ISSAgendaCodes_2023_All_Codes.xlsx) (in the subsequent code, this file is `ISSAgendaCodes_2023_All_Codes.xlsx`).

```{r}
iss_agenda_ids <- read_excel("ISSAgendaCodes_2023_All_Codes.xlsx") |> 
  clean_names() |> 
  mutate(agenda_esg_type = gsub("[^a-zA-Z]", "", proposal_class)) |> 
  select(agenda_code, agenda_esg_type)
  
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  left_join(iss_agenda_ids,
            by = join_by(issagendaitemid == agenda_code))
```

One additional comment on proposal classification is in order. As  @heetal2023 investigate ISS resolution types, they find that not all proposals labeled as SRI (GOV) actually deal with issues related to SRI (GOV). Hence, one should be cautious when using ISS resolution types and `issagendaitemid` without additional checks. In their [online appendix](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/rfs/36/12/10.1093_rfs_hhad033/1/hhad033_supplementary_data.pdf?Expires=1747773259&Signature=eeGoXl0oCUzG2XTBwQ9qiQm5om~OD4wbALbhH1X6i87qd62rARIOySXqUaNMxO54ALDS~M836ayI4A5e1~mx~iOrwto-LQDjQYJD3HuuE5rVkk361lg9nevqO4ezbDSWAUuMdF6LD1p4WY8FB99C~ETlQb4RsS6ZRjFP0XPl3T82zcCDgtRFK89lGtScw0CpP9uzOTlYvkV4hSUjlJaOPafemsMLBfnQ0s3aE7Zcq0k1mjh6Lgtkx-oFH1jTgoo1nb7ANUBGlDVN0bi4IUE9UyI0aZUmyflC4DpWFCpuIk83nHjmFZjhy~kPo3V72~HrZ0q8nBxwDRIukoDDaYnmDg__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA), @heetal2023 provide a list of `issagendaitemid` that actually reflects proposal types related to ecological and social issues and that allows us to gain a higher level of confidence in the classification. In the past, researchers have primarily relied on the coarse resolution type classification by ISS [see, e.g., @cunatetal2012, @flammer2015], which introduces a potential source for replication failures when using more sophisticated classification procedures instead.

As the resolution type variable is only available in the Shareholder Proposals table, we now also extract unique pairs of resolution type and `issagendaitemid` from this dataset. We match these to our Vote Results table. Since it is possible that a given `issagendaitemid` refers to both GOV and SRI, we remove `issagendaitemid`s that correspond to both, GOV and SRI. We document that this is only the case for id `S0810` in the dataset at hand.


```{r}
va_shareholder <- tbl(wrds, I("iss_va_shareholder.va_proposals")) |> 
  distinct(issagendaitemid, resolution_type) |> 
  collect() |> 
  drop_na()
  
va_shareholder |> 
  group_by(issagendaitemid) |>
  summarize(n = n_distinct(resolution_type),
            .groups = "drop") |> 
  filter(n > 1)
  
resolution_types <- va_shareholder |>
  filter(issagendaitemid != "S0810")
  
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |>
  left_join(resolution_types,
            by = join_by(issagendaitemid))
```

We have substantially manipulated the raw data, and to keep things tractable, we now make sure to keep only relevant variables for further analysis.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |>
  select(cusip, name, ticker,
         date = meetingdate, recorddate,
         meetingid, itemonagendaid,
         agenda_esg_type, issagendaitemid, agendageneraldesc, itemdesc, 
         voterequirement, voteresult, vshr, vshr_simple,
         dist_trhd, dist_trhd_simple, pass, pass_simple)
```


## Confounding Proposal Identification

Assume that we aim to explore the effect of passing close-vote ecological and social proposals, i.e., those that have passed or failed close to the majority threshold, on expected and realized returns. In this case, @cunatetal2012 and @flammer2015 correctly point out that there are possibly multiple close-vote proposals per AGM. It is straightforward to account for these proposals if they are also related to ecological or social concerns from an econometric point of view. However, if confounding proposals are of type governance, it becomes infeasible to disentangle the effects of close-vote governance versus close-vote ecological and social proposals on expected and realized returns. We decide to construct count variables that inform us about the number of confounding close-vote proposals (at different distances to the threshold: 5\% , 10\%, and 20\%, respectively) that are not ecologically or socially related. Later, this procedure allows us to run robustness checks by excluding AGMs that had close-vote governance proposals in addition to close-vote ecological or social proposals.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |>
  group_by(cusip, date) |>
  mutate(confounding_close_votes_five = 
           sum(dist_trhd <= 0.05 & !(agenda_esg_type %in% c("E", "S", "ES"))),
         confounding_close_votes_ten =
           sum(dist_trhd <= 0.1 & !(agenda_esg_type %in% c("E", "S", "ES"))),
         confounding_close_votes_twenty =
           sum(dist_trhd <= 0.2 & !(agenda_esg_type %in% c("E", "S", "ES")))) |> 
  ungroup()
```


# Matching with Other Data Sources

To conduct meaningful analyses, we must link shareholder proposal voting outcomes from ISS with other data sources such as CRSP or Compustat. In what follows, we provide code and describe how to match ISS identifiers with CRSP identifiers.

```{r}
va_vote_results <- va_vote_results |> 
  mutate(cusip6 = substr(cusip, 1, 6),
         cusip8 = substr(cusip, 1, 8)) |> 
  rowid_to_column("id")
```

Before the actual matching can be performed, we need to prepare a linking table based on the Security Information History table and the Company Names table from CRSP.

```{r}
stksecurityinfohist_db <- tbl(wrds, I("crsp.stksecurityinfohist"))

stksecurityinfohist <- stksecurityinfohist_db |> 
  mutate(cusip6 = substr(cusip, 1, 6),
         cusip8 = cusip) |> 
  select(secinfostartdt, secinfoenddt,
         permno, cusip6, cusip8, cusip9, ticker) |> 
  filter(!is.na(cusip8) | !is.na(ticker)) |> 
  collect()


stocknames_db <- tbl(wrds, I("crsp.stocknames"))

stocknames <- stocknames_db |> 
  select(namedt, nameenddt,
         permno, comnam) |> 
  collect()


linking_table <- stksecurityinfohist |> 
  full_join(stocknames,
            by = join_by(permno == permno,
                         overlaps(secinfostartdt, secinfoenddt,
                                  namedt, nameenddt))) |>
  mutate(start_date = pmax(secinfostartdt, namedt, na.rm = TRUE),
         end_date = pmin(secinfoenddt, nameenddt, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  select(permno, contains("cusip"), ticker, comnam, start_date, end_date) |> 
  distinct()

```

In the first step, we match ISS CUSIPs with 8- and 6-digit CUSIPs from CRSP. In case there is no appropriate match using CUSIPs, we continue the matching procedure based on standardized company names and tickers. Finally, we check for potential backward-filling in the ISS data by using a forward-looking name/CUSIP/ticker combination. Overall, we can match most shareholder proposals from ISS with CRSP identifying information following our procedure.[^4]

[^4]: Note that we recommend to check unmatched proposals manually and to assign identifying information if available as the total number of unmatched proposal is manageable.

```{r}
matched_va_vote_results <- bind_rows(
  va_vote_results,
  va_vote_results |>
    inner_join(linking_table |>
                 select(start_date, end_date, cusip8, permno) |> 
                 drop_na() |> 
                 distinct(),
               by = join_by(between(date, start_date, end_date),
                            cusip8 == cusip8)) |>
    select(-start_date, -end_date) |> 
    mutate(match = 1),

    mutate(check_name = substr(tolower(gsub("[^a-zA-Z]", "", name)), 1, 10)) |> 
    inner_join(linking_table |>
                 mutate(comnam = substr(tolower(gsub("[^a-zA-Z]", "", comnam)), 1, 10)) |> 
                 select(start_date, end_date, comnam, permno) |> 
                 drop_na() |>
                 distinct(),
               by = join_by(between(date, start_date, end_date),
                            check_name == comnam)) |>

                 distinct(),
               by = join_by(check_name == comnam,
                            cusip8 == cusip8,
                            ticker == ticker)) |>
    select(-check_name) |>

  select(-id, -cusip6, -cusip8, -match)

```


# Coverage

Following our proposed procedure, we end up with a sample of 13,588 shareholder proposals in total (that can be matched to CRSP) spanning a period from 2002 to 2024. In the following plot, we show the number of proposals over time grouped by ESG-type.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false

matched_va_vote_results |> 
  drop_na(permno) |> 
  distinct(itemonagendaid) |> 
  nrow()

```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Number of shareholder proposal over time grouped by ESG-types."
#| fig-alt: "Title: Number of ISS shareholder proposal over time. The figure shows a bar chart with the yearly number of shareholder proposals per ESG-type based on data provided by ISS. The sample covers the years 2003 until 2024."

plot_data <- matched_va_vote_results |>
  mutate(agenda_esg_type = if_else(is.na(agenda_esg_type) | agenda_esg_type == "n/a",
                                   "other", agenda_esg_type)) |> 
  mutate(agenda_esg_type = fct_relevel(agenda_esg_type,
                                       c("E", "ES", "ESG", "S", "SG", "G", "other"))) |> 
  filter(agenda_esg_type != "other") |> 
  drop_na(permno) |> 
  mutate(year = floor_date(date, "year")) |> 
  group_by(year) |> 
  mutate(total_n = n()) |> 
  group_by(year, agenda_esg_type) |> 
  summarize(n = n(),
            total_n = unique(total_n),
            .groups = "drop")

plot_data |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = n, group = agenda_esg_type)) + 
  geom_bar(aes(fill = agenda_esg_type, y = n), position = "stack", stat = "identity", alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_minimal() +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("Number of Shareholder Proposals") +
  guides(color = "none") + 
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Type"))

```

Following the ESG-type classification of ISS, the share of proposals focused on ecological and social issues hardly changes over most parts of the sample period but experiences a spike in recent years (2022 - 2024). This might come as a surprise considering how environmental and sustainability considerations have already shaped the investment industry throughout the last decade. On the other hand, taking into account that governance-type proposals cover "standard topics" such as shareholder rights or issues related to the board of directors, it should be no surprise that this group makes up the largest fraction of proposals throughout.


## Extensions on the Data

The ISS Voting Analytics data is most widely used in empirical finance research studies when it comes to shareholder proposals and proxy voting. Nevertheless, we would like to mention that there are other sources for voting data on shareholder proposals as well. One other prominent source is FactSet, which provides voting data for US firms in the dataset "Proxy Proposals \& N-PX". This database was previously known as SharkRepellent and was acquired by FactSet in 2005.[^5] Currently, we do not have access to this data, but judging by studies that use ISS and FactSet [see, e.g., @flammer2015] jointly, there seems to be a substantial amount of proposals that are either covered by ISS or FactSet. This implies that one can significantly increase overall sample sizes by drawing from both sources.

If one wishes to analyze European shareholder proposal voting data, we refer to the Company Vote Results Global database by ISS. Here, data is available for non-US companies from 2013 onward.

[^5]: Information on the data can be found [here](https://www.factset.com/marketplace/catalog/product/factset-proxy-proposals-and-n-px).
