::: {.callout-note}
You are reading **Tidy Finance with Python**. You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with R** [here](../r/working-with-stock-returns.qmd).
:::

The main aim of this chapter is to familiarize yourself with `pandas` [@mckinney-proc-scipy-2010] and `numpy` [@harris2020array], the main workhorses for data analysis in Python. We start by downloading and visualizing stock data from Yahoo Finance. Then, we move to a simple portfolio choice problem and construct the efficient frontier. These examples introduce you to our approach of *Tidy Finance*.

## Working with Stock Market Data

At the start of each session, we load the required Python packages. Throughout the entire book, we always use `pandas` and `numpy` to perform a number of data manipulations. In this chapter, we also load the convenient `yfinance` [@yfinance] package to download price data.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import yfinance as yf
```

Note that `import pandas as pd` implies that we can call all pandas functions later with a simple `pd.function()`. Instead, utilizing `from pandas import *` is generally discouraged, as it leads to namespace pollution. This statement imports all functions and classes from `pandas` into your current namespace, potentially causing conflicts with functions you define or those from other imported libraries. Using the `pd` abbreviation is a very convenient way to prevent this.\index{pandas}

We first download daily prices for one stock symbol, e.g., the Apple stock, *AAPL*, directly from the data provider Yahoo Finance. To download the data, you can use the function `yf.download()`. 
The data from Yahoo Finance comes as a dataframe, a two-dimensional, tabular data structure in which each row is indexed, and each column has a name. In this case, since only one ticker symbol is requested we specify that the data be returned with a single-level index.
After the download, we apply a set of functions directly on the dataframe. First, we put the date index into a separate column. 
Second, we add the column `symbol` that stores the symbol information, and finally, we rename all columns to lowercase names. Dataframes allow for *chaining* all these operations sequentially through using `.`.\index{Stock prices} \index{Chaining}

```{python}
#| cache: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
prices = (yf.download(
    tickers="AAPL", 
    start="2000-01-01", 
    end="2023-12-31", 
    progress=False,
    auto_adjust=False,
    multi_level_index=False,
  )
  .reset_index()
  .assign(symbol="AAPL")
  .rename(columns={
    "Date": "date", 
    "Open": "open", 
    "High": "high",
    "Low": "low",
    "Close": "close", 
    "Adj Close": "adjusted", 
    "Volume": "volume"}
  )
)
prices.head().round(3)
```

\index{Data!YahooFinance} `yf.download()` downloads stock market data from Yahoo Finance. The above code chunk returns a dataframe with eight quite self-explanatory columns: `date`, the market prices at the `open`, `high`, `low`, and `close`, the `adjusted` price in USD, the daily `volume` (in the number of traded shares), and the `symbol`. The adjusted prices are corrected for anything that might affect the stock price after the market closes, e.g., stock splits and dividends. These actions affect the quoted prices but have no direct impact on the investors who hold the stock. Therefore, we often rely on adjusted prices when it comes to analyzing the returns an investor would have earned by holding the stock continuously.\index{Stock price!Adjustments}

Next, we use the `plotnine` [@plotnine] package to visualize the time series of adjusted prices in @fig-100. This package takes care of visualization tasks based on the principles of the Grammar of Graphics [@Wilkinson2012]. Note that generally, we do not recommend using the `*` import style. However, we use it here only for the plotting functions, which are distinct to `plotnine` and have very plotting-related names. So, the risk of misuse through a polluted namespace is marginal.\index{Graph!Time series}

```{python}
from plotnine import *
```

```{python}
#| echo: false
exec(open("./render-plotnine-custom.py").read())
```

Creating figures becomes very intuitive with the Grammar of Graphics, as the following code chunk demonstrates.

```{python}
#| label: fig-100 
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows Apple stock prices between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2023. Prices are in USD, adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits."
#| fig-alt: "Title: Apple stock prices between the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2023. The figure shows that the stock price of Apple increased dramatically from about 1 USD to around 125 USD."
#| fig-pos: "htb"
prices_figure = (
  ggplot(prices, 
         aes(y="adjusted", x="date")) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x="", y="",
       title="Apple stock prices from 2000 to 2023")
)
prices_figure.draw()
```

\index{Returns} Instead of analyzing prices, we compute daily returns defined as

$$r_t = p_t / p_{t-1} - 1,
$${#eq-return-definition}

where $p_t$ is the adjusted price on day $t$. In that context, the function `pct_change()` is helpful because it computes this percentage change.

```{python}
returns = (prices
  .sort_values("date")
  .assign(ret=lambda x: x["adjusted"].pct_change())
  .get(["symbol", "date", "ret"])
)
```
```{python}
#| echo: false
returns.head().round(3)
```

The resulting dataframe contains three columns, where the last contains the daily returns (`ret`). Note that the first entry naturally contains a missing value (`NaN`) because there is no previous price.\index{Missing value} Obviously, the use of `pct_change()` would be meaningless if the time series is not ordered by ascending dates.\index{Lag observations} The function `sort_values()` provides a convenient way to order observations in the correct way for our application. In case you want to order observations by descending dates, you can use the parameter `ascending=False`.

For the upcoming examples, we remove missing values, as these would require separate treatment when computing, e.g., sample averages. In general, however, make sure you understand why `NA` values occur and carefully examine if you can simply get rid of these observations. The dataframe `dropna()` method kicks out all rows that contain a missing value in any column.

```{python}
returns = returns.dropna() 
```

Next, we visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram in @fig-101, where we also introduce the `mizani` [@mizani] package for formatting functions. \index{Graph!Histogram} Additionally, we add a dashed line that indicates the five percent quantile of the daily returns to the histogram, which is a (crude) proxy for the worst return of the stock with a probability of at most five percent. The five percent quantile is closely connected to the (historical) value-at-risk, a risk measure commonly monitored by regulators. \index{Value-at-risk} We refer to @Tsay2010 for a more thorough introduction to stylized facts of returns.\index{Returns}

```{python}
#| label: fig-101 
#| fig-alt: "Title: Distribution of daily Apple stock returns in percent. The figure shows a histogram of daily returns. The range indicates a few large negative values, while the remaining returns are distributed around 0. The vertical line indicates that the historical five percent quantile of daily returns was around negative three percent."
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows a histogram of daily Apple stock returns in percent. The dotted vertical line indicates the historical five percent quantile."
#| fig-pos: "htb"
from mizani.formatters import percent_format

quantile_05 = returns["ret"].quantile(0.05)

returns_figure = (
  ggplot(returns, aes(x="ret")) +
  geom_histogram(bins=100) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=quantile_05), 
                 linetype="dashed") +
  labs(x="", y="",
       title="Distribution of daily Apple stock returns") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels=percent_format())
)
returns_figure.draw()
```

Here, `bins=100` determines the number of bins used in the illustration and, hence, implicitly the width of the bins. Before proceeding, make sure you understand how to use the geom `geom_vline()` to add a dashed line that indicates the five percent quantile of the daily returns. A typical task before proceeding with *any* data is to compute summary statistics for the main variables of interest.

```{python}
pd.DataFrame(returns["ret"].describe()).round(3).T
```

We see that the maximum *daily* return was `{python} round(returns["ret"].max()*100, 1)` percent. Perhaps not surprisingly, the average daily return is close to but slightly above 0. In line with the illustration above, the large losses on the day with the minimum returns indicate a strong asymmetry in the distribution of returns.

You can also compute these summary statistics for each year individually by imposing `.groupby(returns["date"].dt.year)`, where the call `.dt.year` returns the year of a date variable. More specifically, the few lines of code below compute the summary statistics from above for individual groups of data defined by year. The summary statistics, therefore, allow an eyeball analysis of the time-series dynamics of the return distribution.

```{python}
(returns["ret"]
  .groupby(returns["date"].dt.year)
  .describe()
  .round(3)
)
```

\index{Summary statistics}

## Scaling Up the Analysis

As a next step, we generalize the code from before such that all the computations can handle an arbitrary vector of stock symbols (e.g., all constituents of an index). Following tidy principles, it is quite easy to download the data, plot the price time series, and tabulate the summary statistics for an arbitrary number of assets.

This is where the magic starts: tidy data makes it extremely easy to generalize the computations from before to as many assets as you like. The following code takes any vector of symbols, e.g., `symbol=["AAPL", "MMM", "BA"]`, and automates the download as well as the plot of the price time series. In the end, we create the table of summary statistics for an arbitrary number of assets. We perform the analysis with data from all current constituents of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average index.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) \index{Data!Dow Jones Index}

We first download a table with DOW Jones constituents from an external website. Note that you need to temporarily modify the behavior of handling SSL certificates in Python's `ssl` module when reading the constituents directly from the web. This approach should be used with caution, which is why we revert the setting to the default behavior after the successful data download. 

```{python}
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

url = ("https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/library-content/"
       "products/fund-data/etfs/us/holdings-daily-us-en-dia.xlsx")

symbols = (pd.read_excel(url, skiprows=4, nrows=30)
  .get("Ticker")
  .tolist()
)

ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl.create_default_context
```

Next, we can use `yf.download()` to download prices for all stock symbols in the above list and again  chain a couple of `pandas` dataframe functions to create a tidy dataset. 

```{python}
#| cache: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
prices_daily = (yf.download(
    tickers=symbols, 
    start="2000-01-01", 
    end="2023-12-31", 
    progress=False,
    auto_adjust=False,
    multi_level_index=False
  ))

prices_daily = (prices_daily
  .stack()
  .reset_index(level=1, drop=False)
  .reset_index()
  .rename(columns={
    "Date": "date",
    "Ticker": "symbol",
    "Open": "open",
    "High": "high",
    "Low": "low",
    "Close": "close",
    "Adj Close": "adjusted",
    "Volume": "volume"}
  )
)
```

The resulting dataframe contains `{python} f'{len(prices_daily):,}'` daily observations for `{python} f'{len(prices_daily["symbol"].unique()):,}'` different stock symbols. @fig-103 illustrates the time series of downloaded *adjusted* prices for each of the constituents of the Dow Jones index. We again draw on the `mizani` package, but this time we use its useful date formatting function to get nicer axis labels. Make sure you understand every single line of code! What are the arguments of `aes()`? Which alternative `geoms` could you use to visualize the time series? Hint: If you do not know the answers, try to change the code to see what difference your intervention causes.

```{python}
#| label: fig-103
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows the stock prices of DOW index constituents. Prices are in USD, adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits." 
#| fig-alt: "Title: Stock prices of DOW index constituents. The figure shows many time series with daily prices. The general trend seems positive for most stocks in the DOW index."
#| fig-pos: "htb"
from mizani.breaks import date_breaks
from mizani.formatters import date_format

prices_daily_figure = (
  ggplot(prices_daily, 
         aes(y="adjusted", x="date", color="symbol")) +
 geom_line() +
 labs(x="", y="", color="",
      title="Stock prices of DOW index constituents") +
 theme(legend_position="none") +
 scale_x_datetime(date_breaks="5 years", date_labels="%Y")
)
prices_daily_figure.draw()
```

Do you notice the small differences relative to the code we used before? `yf.download(symbols)` returns a dataframe for several symbols as well. All we need to do to illustrate all symbols simultaneously is to include `color="symbol"` in the `ggplot` aesthetics. In this way, we generate a separate line for each symbol. Of course, there are simply too many lines on this graph to identify the individual stocks properly, but it illustrates the point well.

The same holds for stock returns. Before computing the returns, we use `groupby("symbol")` such that the `assign()` command is performed to calculate the returns for each symbol individually and assign it to the variable `ret` in the dataframe. The same logic also applies to the computation of summary statistics: `groupby("symbol")` is the key to aggregating the time series into symbol-specific variables of interest.

```{python}
returns_daily = (prices_daily
  .assign(ret=lambda x: x.groupby("symbol")["adjusted"].pct_change())
  .get(["symbol", "date", "ret"])
  .dropna(subset="ret")
)

(returns_daily
  .groupby("symbol")["ret"]
  .describe()
  .round(3)
)
```

\index{Summary statistics}

## Other Forms of Data Aggregation

Of course, aggregation across variables other than `symbol` can also make sense. For instance, suppose you are interested in answering the question: Are days with high aggregate trading volume likely followed by days with high aggregate trading volume? To provide some initial analysis on this question, we take the downloaded data and compute aggregate daily trading volume for all Dow Jones constituents in USD. Recall that the column `volume` is denoted in the number of traded shares.\index{Trading volume} Thus, we multiply the trading volume with the daily adjusted closing price to get a proxy for the aggregate trading volume in USD. Scaling by `1e9` (Python can handle scientific notation) denotes daily trading volume in billion USD.

```{python}
#| label: fig-104
#| fig-cap: "The figure shows the total daily trading volume in billion USD."
#| fig-alt: "Title: Aggregate daily trading volume. The figure shows a volatile time series of daily trading volume, ranging from 15 in 2000 to 20.5 in 2023, with a maximum of more than 100."
#| fig-pos: "htb"
trading_volume = (prices_daily
  .assign(trading_volume=lambda x: (x["volume"]*x["adjusted"])/1e9)
  .groupby("date")["trading_volume"]
  .sum()
  .reset_index()
  .assign(trading_volume_lag=lambda x: x["trading_volume"].shift(periods=1))
)

trading_volume_figure = (
  ggplot(trading_volume, 
          aes(x="date", y="trading_volume")) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x="", y="",
       title=("Aggregate daily trading volume of DOW index constituents "
              "in billion USD"))  +
 scale_x_datetime(date_breaks="5 years", date_labels="%Y")
)
trading_volume_figure.draw()
```

@fig-104 indicates a clear upward trend in aggregated daily trading volume. In particular, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, markets have processed substantial trading volumes, as analyzed, for instance, by @Goldstein2021.\index{Covid 19} One way to illustrate the persistence of trading volume would be to plot volume on day $t$ against volume on day $t-1$ as in the example below. In @fig-105, we add a dotted 45°-line to indicate a hypothetical one-to-one relation by `geom_abline()`, addressing potential differences in the axes' scales.

```{python}
#| warning: false
#| label: fig-105
#| fig-cap: "The figure a scatterplot of aggregate trading volume against previous-day aggregate trading volume."
#| fig-alt: "Title: Persistence in daily trading volume of DOW index constituents. The figure shows a scatterplot where aggregate trading volume and previous-day aggregate trading volume neatly line up along a 45-degree line."
#| fig-pos: "htb"
trading_volume_figure = (
  ggplot(trading_volume, 
         aes(x="trading_volume_lag", y="trading_volume")) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_abline(aes(intercept=0, slope=1), linetype="dashed") +
  labs(x="Previous day aggregate trading volume",
       y="Aggregate trading volume",
       title=("Persistence in daily trading volume of DOW constituents "
              "in billion USD"))
)
trading_volume_figure.draw()
```

## Portfolio Choice Problems

In the previous part, we show how to download stock market data and inspect it with graphs and summary statistics. Now, we move to a typical question in Finance: How to allocate wealth across different assets optimally.\index{Portfolio choice} The standard framework for optimal portfolio selection considers investors that prefer higher future returns but dislike future return volatility (defined as the square root of the return variance, i.e., the risk): the *mean-variance investor* [@Markowitz1952].\index{Markowitz optimization}

\index{Efficient frontier} An essential tool to evaluate portfolios in the mean-variance context is the *efficient frontier*, the set of portfolios that satisfies the condition that no other portfolio exists with a higher expected return but with the same volatility, see, e.g., @Merton1972.\index{Return volatility} We compute and visualize the efficient frontier for several stocks. First, we extract each asset's *ly* returns. In order to keep things simple, we work with a balanced panel and exclude DOW constituents for which we do not observe a price on every single trading day since the year 2000.

```{python}
prices_monthly = (prices_daily
  .groupby("symbol")
  .apply(lambda x: x.assign(counts=x["adjusted"].dropna().count()))
  .reset_index(drop=True)
  .query("counts == counts.max()")
)
```

Next, we transform the returns from a tidy dataframe into a $(T \times N)$ matrix with one column for each of the $N$ symbols and one row for each of the $T$ trading days to compute the sample average return vector 
$$\hat\mu = \frac{1}{T}\sum\limits_{t=1}^T r_t,$${#eq-sample-mean} 
where $r_t$ is the $N$ vector of returns on date $t$ and the sample covariance matrix 
$$\hat\Sigma = \frac{1}{T-1}\sum\limits_{t=1}^T (r_t - \hat\mu)(r_t - \hat\mu)'.$${#eq-sample-variance}
We achieve this by using `pivot()` with the new column names from the column `symbol` and setting the values to `adjusted`. 

In financial econometrics, a core focus falls on problems that arise if the investor has to rely on estimates $\hat\mu$ and $\hat\Sigma$ instead of using the vector of expected returns $\mu$ and the variance-covariance matrix $\Sigma$. We highlight the impact of estimation uncertainty on the portfolio performance in various backtesting applications in [Parametric Portfolio Policies](parametric-portfolio-policies.qmd) and [Constrained Optimization and Backtesting.](constrained-optimization-and-backtesting.qmd)

For now, we focus on a much more restricted set of assumptions: The $N$ assets are fixed, and the first two moments of the distribution of the returns are determined by the parameters $\mu$ and $\Sigma$. Thus, even though we proceed with the vector of sample average returns and the sample variance-covariance matrix, those will be handled as the *true* parameters of the return distribution for the rest of this chapter. We, therefore, refer to $\Sigma$ and $\mu$ instead of explicitly highlighting that the sample moments are estimates. \index{Covariance}

```{python}
returns_matrix = (prices_monthly
  .pivot(columns="symbol", values="adjusted", index="date")
  .resample("m")
  .last()
  .pct_change()
  .dropna()
)
mu = np.array(returns_matrix.mean()).T
sigma = np.array(returns_matrix.cov())
```

Then, we compute the minimum variance portfolio weights $\omega_\text{mvp}$ as well as the expected return $\omega_\text{mvp}'\mu$ and volatility $\sqrt{\omega_\text{mvp}'\Sigma\omega_\text{mvp}}$ of this portfolio. \index{Minimum variance portfolio} Recall that the minimum variance portfolio is the vector of portfolio weights that are the solution to $$\omega_\text{mvp} = \arg\min \omega'\Sigma \omega \text{ s.t. } \sum\limits_{i=1}^N\omega_i = 1.$${#eq-minimum-variance} The constraint that weights sum up to one simply implies that all funds are distributed across the available asset universe, i.e., there is no possibility to retain cash. It is easy to show analytically that $\omega_\text{mvp} = \frac{\Sigma^{-1}\iota}{\iota'\Sigma^{-1}\iota}$, where $\iota$ is a vector of ones and $\Sigma^{-1}$ is the inverse of $\Sigma$. We provide the proof of the analytical solution in [Proofs](proofs.qmd).

```{python}
N = returns_matrix.shape[1]
iota = np.ones(N)
sigma_inv = np.linalg.inv(sigma) 

mvp_weights = sigma_inv @ iota
mvp_weights = mvp_weights/mvp_weights.sum()
mvp_return = mu.T @ mvp_weights
mvp_volatility = np.sqrt(mvp_weights.T @ sigma @ mvp_weights)
mvp_moments = pd.DataFrame({"value": [mvp_return, mvp_volatility]},
                           index=["average_ret", "volatility"])
mvp_moments.round(3)
```

The command `np.linalg.inv()` returns the inverse of a matrix such that `np.linalg.inv(sigma)` delivers $\Sigma^{-1}$ (if a unique solution exists). 

Note that the *monthly* volatility of the minimum variance portfolio is of the same order of magnitude as the *daily* standard deviation of the individual components. Thus, the diversification benefits in terms of risk reduction are tremendous!\index{Diversification}


Next, we set out to find the weights for a portfolio that achieves, as an example, three times the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio. However, mean-variance investors are not interested in any portfolio that achieves the required return but rather in the efficient portfolio, i.e., the portfolio with the lowest standard deviation. If you wonder where the solution $\omega_\text{eff}$ comes from: \index{Efficient portfolio} The efficient portfolio is chosen by an investor who aims to achieve minimum variance *given a minimum acceptable expected return* $\bar{\mu}$. Hence, their objective function is to choose $\omega_\text{eff}$ as the solution to $$\omega_\text{eff}(\bar{\mu}) = \arg\min \omega'\Sigma \omega \text{ s.t. } \omega'\iota = 1 \text{ and } \omega'\mu \geq \bar{\mu}.$${#eq-efficient-portfolio}

In [Proofs](proofs.qmd), we show that the efficient portfolio takes the form (for $\bar{\mu} \geq D/C = \mu'\omega_\text{mvp}$) $$\omega_\text{eff}\left(\bar\mu\right) = \omega_\text{mvp} + \frac{\tilde\lambda}{2}\left(\Sigma^{-1}\mu -\frac{D}{C}\Sigma^{-1}\iota \right)$$
where $C:= \iota'\Sigma^{-1}\iota$, $D:= \iota'\Sigma^{-1}\mu$, $E:= \mu'\Sigma^{-1}\mu$, and $\tilde\lambda = 2\frac{\bar\mu - D/C}{E-D^2/C}$.

The code below implements the analytic solution to this optimization problem for a benchmark return $\bar\mu$, which we set to 3 times the expected return of the minimum variance portfolio. We encourage you to verify that it is correct.

```{python}
benchmark_multiple = 3
mu_bar = benchmark_multiple*mvp_return
C = iota.T @ sigma_inv @ iota
D = iota.T @ sigma_inv @ mu
E = mu.T @ sigma_inv @ mu
lambda_tilde = 2*(mu_bar-D/C)/(E-D**2/C)
efp_weights = mvp_weights+lambda_tilde/2*(sigma_inv @ mu-D*mvp_weights)
```

## The Efficient Frontier

\index{Separation theorem} The mutual fund separation theorem states that as soon as we have two efficient portfolios (such as the minimum variance portfolio $\omega_\text{mvp}$ and the efficient portfolio for a higher required level of expected returns $\omega_\text{eff}(\bar{\mu})$, we can characterize the entire efficient frontier by combining these two portfolios. That is, any linear combination of the two portfolio weights will again represent an efficient portfolio. \index{Efficient frontier} The code below implements the construction of the *efficient frontier*, which characterizes the highest expected return achievable at each level of risk. To understand the code better, make sure to familiarize yourself with the inner workings of the `for` loop.

```{python}
length_year = 12
a = np.arange(-0.4, 2.0, 0.01)
results = pd.DataFrame(columns=["mu", "sd"], index=a).astype(float)

for i in a:
    w = (1-i)*mvp_weights+i*efp_weights
    results.loc[i, "mu"] = (w.T @ mu)*length_year
    results.loc[i, "sd"] = np.sqrt(w.T @ sigma @ w)*np.sqrt(length_year)
```

The code above proceeds in two steps: First, we compute a vector of combination weights $a$, and then we evaluate the resulting linear combination with $a\in\mathbb{R}$:\
$$\omega^* = a\omega_\text{eff}(\bar\mu) + (1-a)\omega_\text{mvp} = \omega_\text{mvp} + \frac{\lambda^*}{2}\left(\Sigma^{-1}\mu -\frac{D}{C}\Sigma^{-1}\iota \right)$${#eq-two-fund-separation} with $\lambda^* = 2\frac{a\bar\mu + (1-a)\tilde\mu - D/C}{E-D^2/C}$. It follows that $\omega^* = \omega_\text{eff}\left(a\bar\mu + (1-a)\tilde\mu\right)$, in other words, $\omega^*$ is an efficient portfolio that proofs the mutual fund separation theorem.  

Finally, it is simple to visualize the efficient frontier alongside the two efficient portfolios within one powerful figure using the `ggplot` function from `plotnine` (see @fig-106). We also add the individual stocks in the same call. We compute annualized returns based on the simple assumption that monthly returns are independent and identically distributed. Thus, the average annualized return is just twelve times the expected monthly return.\index{Graph!Efficient frontier}

```{python}

The line in @fig-106 indicates the efficient frontier: the set of portfolios a mean-variance efficient investor would choose from. Compare the performance relative to the individual assets (the dots); it should become clear that diversifying yields massive performance gains (at least as long as we take the parameters $\Sigma$ and $\mu$ as given).

## Exercises

1. Download daily prices for another stock market symbol of your choice from Yahoo Finance with `yf.download()` from the `yfinance` package. Plot two time series of the symbol’s unadjusted and adjusted closing prices. Explain the differences.
1. Compute daily net returns for an asset of your choice and visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram using 100 bins. Also, use `geom_vline()` to add a dashed red vertical line that indicates the five percent quantile of the daily returns. Compute summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum) for the daily returns.
1. Take your code from before and generalize it such that you can perform all the computations for an arbitrary vector of symbols (e.g., `symbol = ["AAPL", "MMM", "BA"]`). Automate the download, the plot of the price time series, and create a table of return summary statistics for this arbitrary number of assets.
1. Are days with high aggregate trading volume often also days with large absolute returns? Find an appropriate visualization to analyze the question using the symbol `AAPL`.
1. Compute monthly returns from the downloaded stock market prices. Compute the vector of historical average returns and the sample variance-covariance matrix. Compute the minimum variance portfolio weights and the portfolio volatility and average returns. Visualize the mean-variance efficient frontier. Choose one of your assets and identify the portfolio which yields the same historical volatility but achieves the highest possible average return.
1. In the portfolio choice analysis, we restricted our sample to all assets trading every day since 2000. How is such a decision a problem when you want to infer future expected portfolio performance from the results?
1. The efficient frontier characterizes the portfolios with the highest expected return for different levels of risk. Identify the portfolio with the highest expected return per standard deviation. Which famous performance measure is close to the ratio of average returns to the standard deviation of returns?
