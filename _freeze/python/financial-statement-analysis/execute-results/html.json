You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with R** [here](../r/financial-statement-analysis.qmd).\n:::\n\nFinancial statements and ratios are fundamental tools for understanding and evaluating companies. While we discuss how assets are priced in equilibrium in the previous chapter on the [Capital Asset Pricing Model](capital-asset-pricing-model.qmd), this chapter examines how investors and analysts assess companies using accounting information. Financial statements serve as the primary source of standardized information about a company's operations, financial position, and performance. Their standardization and legal requirements make them particularly valuable as all companies must file financial statements.\n\nBuilding on this standardized information, financial ratios transform raw accounting data into meaningful metrics that facilitate analysis across companies and over time. These ratios serve multiple purposes in both academic research and practical applications. They enable investors to benchmark companies against their peers, identify industry trends, and screen for investment opportunities. In academic finance, ratios play a crucial role in asset pricing models (e.g., the book-to-market ratio in the Fama-French three-factor model) and corporate finance (e.g., capital structure research). In many practical applications, ratios help assess a company's financial health and performance.\n\nThis chapter demonstrates how to access, process, and analyze financial statements using R. We start by reviewing the financial statements balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Then, we download publicly available statements to calculate key financial ratios, implement common screening strategies, and evaluate companies. Our analysis combines theoretical frameworks with practical implementation, providing tools for both academic research and investment practice.\n\nFor the purpose of this chapter, we use financial statements provided by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (i.e., SEC). While the SEC provides a web interface to search filings, programmatic access to financial statements greatly facilitates systematic analyses as ours. The Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API offers such programmatic access, which we can leverage through the R package `fmpapi`.\n\nThe FMP API's free tier provides access to:\n\n- 250 API calls per day,\n- Five years of historical fundamental data,\n- Real-time and historical stock prices, and\n- Key financial ratios and metrics.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\nThe `fmpapi` package is developed by Christoph Scheuch and not sponsored by or affiliated with FMP.

The statement lists all uses (assets) and sources (liabilities and equity) of funds, which result in the fundamental accounting equation:\n\n$$\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Equity}$$\n\nThis equation reflects a core principle of accounting: a company's resources (assets) must equal its sources of funding, whether from creditors (liabilities) or investors (shareholders' equity). Assets represent resources that the company controls and expects to generate future economic benefits, such as cash, inventory, or equipment. Liabilities encompass all obligations to external parties, from short-term payables to long-term debt. Shareholders' equity represents the residual claim on assets after accounting for all liabilities.\n\n@fig-400 provides a stylized representation of a balance sheet's structure. The visualization highlights how assets on the left side must equal the combined claims of creditors and shareholders on the right side.\n\n![A stylized representation of a balance sheet statement.](../assets/img/balance-sheet.svg){#fig-400 alt=\"A stylized representation of a balance sheet where assests equal the combination of liabilities and equity.\"}\n\nThe asset side of the balance sheet typically comprises three main categories, each serving different roles in the company's operations:\n\n1. Current assets: These are assets expected to be converted into cash or used within one operating cycle (typically one year). They include, e.g., cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable (money owed by customers), and inventory (raw materials, work in progress, and finished goods).\n1. Non-current assets: These long-term assets support the company's operations beyond one year like, e.g., property, plant, and equipment (PP&E), long-term investments, and other long-term assets.\n1. Intangible assets: These non-physical assets often represent significant value in modern companies, e.g., patents and intellectual property, trademarks and brands, and goodwill from acquisitions (a premium paid on the book value of the acquired assets). Intangible assets are usually also considered long-term assets, which means that they are included in the group of non-current assets.\n\n@fig-401 illustrates this breakdown of assets, showing how companies classify their resources.\n \n![A stylized representation of a balance sheet beakdown.](../assets/img/balance-sheet-breakdown.svg){#fig-401 alt=\"A financial statement diagram categorizing assets, liabilities, and equity. On the left side, assets are divided into 'Current Assets’ and 'Non-Current Assets.’ Current Assets include Cash, Accounts Receivable, and Inventory. Non-Current Assets include Property, Plant & Equipment, and Intangible Assets. On the right side, liabilities and equity are categorized. 'Current Liabilities’ include Accounts Payable and Short-Term Debt. 'Non-Current Liabilities’ include Long-Term Debt and Deferred Taxes. Below the liabilities, equity items include Retained Earnings, Common Stock, and Preferred Stock. Brackets are used to group related items.\"}\n\n@fig-401 also shows the breakdown of liabilities. The liability side similarly follows a temporal classification, dividing obligations based on when they come due:\n\n1. Current liabilities: Obligations due within one year such as accounts payable, short-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and accrued expenses.\n1. Non-current liabilities: Long-term obligations such as long-term debt, bonds payable, deferred tax liabilities, and pension obligations.\n\nLastly, the equity section represents ownership claims and typically consists of:\n\n- Retained earnings: Accumulated profits reinvested in the business. \n- Common stock: Par value and additional paid-in capital from share issuance.\n- Preferred stock: Hybrid securities with characteristics of both debt and equity.\n\n@fig-401 also depicts this equity structure, showing how companies track different forms of ownership claims.\n\nTo illustrate these concepts in practice, @fig-404 presents Microsoft's balance sheet from 2023. This real-world example demonstrates how one of the world's largest technology companies structures its financial position, reflecting both traditional elements like PP&E and modern aspects like significant intangible assets. \n\n![A screenshot of the balance sheet statement of Microsoft in 2023.](../assets/img/balance-sheet-msft.png){#fig-404 alt=\"A screenshot of the balance sheet statement of Microsoft in 2023.\"}\n\nWhile there are more details, the basic structure is exactly the same as in the introduction above. Importantly, the balance sheet obeys the fundamental accounting equation as assets are equal to the sum of liabilities and equity. In subsequent sections, we will explore how to analyze such statements using financial ratios, particularly focusing on measures of liquidity, solvency, and efficiency.\n\nLet us examine Microsoft's balance sheet statements using the `fmp_get()` function. This function requires three main arguments: The type of financial data to retrieve (`resource`), the stock ticker symbol (`symbol`), and additional parameters like periodicity and number of periods (`params`).\n\n::: {#6c7e568f .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfmp_get(\n  resource=\"balance-sheet-statement\", \n  symbol=\"MSFT\", \n  params={\"period\": \"annual\", \"limit\":

This structured format makes it easy to analyze trends over time and calculate financial ratios. We can see how the data aligns with the balance sheet components we discussed earlier, from current assets like cash and receivables to long-term assets and various forms of liabilities and equity.\n\n## Income Statements\n\nWhile the balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company's financial position at a point in time, the income statement (also called profit and loss statement or PnL) measures financial performance over a period, typically a quarter or year. It follows a hierarchical structure that progressively captures different levels of profitability:\n\n- Revenue (Sales): The total income generated from goods or services sold.\n- Cost of goods sold (COGS): Direct costs associated with producing the goods or services (raw materials, labor, etc.).\n- Gross profit: Revenue minus COGS, showing the basic profitability from core operations.\n- Operating expenses: Costs related to regular business operations (e.g., salaries, rent, and marketing).\n- Operating income (EBIT): Earnings before interest and taxes (measures profitability from core operations before financing and tax costs), often also referred to as operating profit.\n- Interest and taxes: The interest paid on debt is deducted for determining the taxable income.\n- Net income: The “bottom line”, total profit after all expenses, interest, and taxes are subtracted from revenue.\n\n@fig-405 illustrates this progression from total revenue to net income, showing how various costs and expenses are subtracted to arrive at different measure of profit.\n\n![A stylized representation of an income statement.](../assets/img/income-statements.svg){#fig-405 alt=\"A stylized

compare across companies and industries. The income statement's focus on performance complements the balance sheet's position snapshot, providing a more complete picture of a company's core business operations\n\n## Cash Flow Statements\n\nThe cash flow statement complements the balance sheet and income statement by tracking the actual movement of cash through the business. While the income statement shows profitability and the balance sheet shows financial position, the cash flow statement reveals a company's ability to generate and manage cash - a crucial aspect of every business. The statement is divided into three main categories:\n\n- Operating activities: Cash generated from a company’s core business activities (i.e., net income adjusted for non-cash items like depreciation and changes in working capital).\n- Financing activities: Cash flows related to borrowing, repaying debt, issuing equity, or paying dividends.\n- Investing activities: Cash spent on or received from long-term investments, such as purchasing or selling property and equipment.\n\n@fig-407 illustrates these three categories of cash flows, which map into changes in the company's cash balance.\n\n![A stylized representation of a cash flow statement.](../assets/img/cash-flow-statements.svg){#fig-407 alt=\"A stylized representation of a cash flow statement in three groups: Operating activities, financing activities, and investing activities.\"}\n\nThe statement reconciles accrual-based accounting (used in the income statement) with actual cash movements. This reconciliation is crucial because profitable companies can still face cash shortages, and unprofitable companies might maintain positive cash flow. We complement the brief introduction, by Microsoft's 2023 cash flow statement in @fig-408.\n\n![A screenshot of the cash flow statement of Microsoft in

efficiency, and overall financial sustainability. The combination of all three financial statements - balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement - provides a comprehensive view of a company's financial health and performance.\n\n## Download Financial Statements\n\nWe now turn to downloading and processing statements for multiple companies. The next code chunk demonstrates how to retrieve financial data for all constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, similar to our approach in the CAPM chapter.\n\n::: {#4b75c958 .cell cache='true' execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport ssl\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\n\nurl = (\"https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/library-content/\"\n       \"products/fund-data/etfs/us/holdings-daily-us-en-dia.xlsx\")\n\nconstituents = (pd.read_excel(url, skiprows=4, nrows=30)\n  .get(\"Ticker\")\n  .tolist()\n)\n\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl.create_default_context\n\nparams = {\"period\": \"annual\", \"limit\": 5}\n\nbalance_sheet_statements = pd.concat(\n  [fmp_get(\n      resource=\"balance-sheet-statement\", symbol=x, params=params, to_pandas=True\n    ) for x in constituents],\n  ignore_index=True\n)\n\nincome_statements = pd.concat(\n  [fmp_get(\n      resource=\"income-statement\", symbol=x, params=params, to_pandas=True\n    ) for x in constituents],\n  ignore_index=True\n)\n\ncash_flow_statements = pd.concat(\n  [fmp_get(\n      resource=\"cash-flow-statement\", symbol=x, params=params, to_pandas=True\n    ) for x in constituents],\n  ignore_index=True\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting data sets provide a foundation for cross-sectional analyses of financial ratios and trends across major U.S. companies. In the following sections, we use these data sets to calculate various financial ratios and analyze patterns in corporate financial performance.\n\n## Liquidity Ratios\n\nLiquidity ratios assess a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and are typically calculated using balance sheet items. These ratios are particularly important for creditors and investors concerned about a company's short-term financial health and ability to cover immediate obligations.\n\nThe Current Ratio is the most basic measure of liquidity, comparing all current assets to current liabilities:\n\n$$\\text{Current Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets}}{\\text{Total Liabilities}}$$\n\nA ratio above one indicates that the company has enough current assets to cover its current liabilities, which are due within one year as discussed above. \n\nHowever, not all current assets are equally liquid, i.e., can be easily sold to meet a company's obligations. This aspect is reflected in the Quick Ratio:\n\n$$\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Current Assets - Inventory}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}$$\nThe Quick Ratio provides a more stringent measure of liquidity by excluding inventory, which is typically the least liquid current asset. Furthermore, a company without inventory for production or sale will have a difficult operating position. A ratio above one suggests strong short-term solvency without relying on selling off inventory.\n\nThe most conservative liquidity measure is the Cash Ratio:\n\n$$\\text{Cash Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Cash and Cash Equivalents}}{\\text{Current Liabilities}}$$\n\nThis ratio focuses solely on the most liquid assets - cash and cash equivalents. While a ratio of one indicates robust liquidity, most companies maintain lower cash ratios to avoid holding excessive non-productive assets. Afterall, all that cash could also be distributed to equity or pay down costly debt.\n\nNext, we calculate these ratios for Dow Jones constituents, focusing on three major technology companies:\n\n::: {#939f0430 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nselected_symbols = [\"MSFT\", \"AAPL\", \"AMZN\"]\n\nbalance_sheet_statements = (balance_sheet_statements\n  .assign(\n    current_ratio=lambda x: x[\"total_current_assets\"] / x[\"total_assets\"],\n    quick_ratio=lambda x: (x[\"total_current_assets\"] - x[\"inventory\"]) / x[\"total_current_liabilities\"],\n    cash_ratio=lambda x: x[\"cash_and_cash_equivalents\"] / x[\"total_current_liabilities\"],\n    label=lambda x: np.where(x[\"symbol\"].isin(selected_symbols), x[\"symbol\"], np.nan)\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n@fig-409 compares the three liquidity ratios across Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon for 2023.

Generally, higher liquidity ratios signal a more convervative approach by holding larger liquidity buffers in the company. \n\n## Leverage Ratios\n\nLeverage ratios assess a company's capital structure, in particular, its mix between debt and equity. These metrics are crucial for understanding the company's financial risk and long-term solvency. We examine three key leverage measures.\n\nThe debt-to-equity ratio indicates how much a company is financing its operations through debt versus shareholders' equity:\n\n$$\\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Equity}}$$\n\nThe debt-to-asset ratio shows the percentage of assets financed through debt:\n\n$$\\text{Debt-to-Asset} = \\frac{\\text{Total Debt}}{\\text{Total Assets}}$$\n\nInterest coverage measures a company's ability to meet interest payments:\n\n$$\\text{Interest Coverage} = \\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expense}}$$\n\nLet's calculate these ratios for our sample of companies:\n\n::: {#ff1c4a51 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbalance_sheet_statements = balance_sheet_statements.assign(\n  debt_to_equity=lambda x: x[\"total_debt\"] / x[\"total_equity\"],\n  debt_to_asset=lambda x: x[\"total_debt\"] / x[\"total_assets\"]\n)\n\nincome_statements = income_statements.assign(\n  interest_coverage=lambda x: x[\"operating_income\"] / x[\"interest_expense\"],\n  label=lambda x: np.where(x[\"symbol\"].isin(selected_symbols), x[\"symbol\"], np.nan)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n@fig-410 tracks the evolution of debt-to-asset ratios for Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon over time:\n\n::: {#cell-fig-410 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndebt_to_asset = (balance_sheet_statements\n  .query(\"symbol in @selected_symbols\")\n)\n\ndebt_to_asset_figure = (\n  ggplot(\n    debt_to_asset,\n    aes(x=\"calendar_year\", y=\"debt_to_asset\", color=\"symbol\")\n  )\n  + geom_line(size=1)\n  + scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())\n  + labs(\n      x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\",\n      title=\"Debt-to-asset ratios of selected stocks between 2020 and 2024\"\n    ) \n)\ndebt_to_asset_figure.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Debt-to-asset ratios are based on financial statements provided through the FMP API.](financial-statement-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-410-output-1.png){#fig-410 width=2100 height=1500 fig-alt='Title: Debt-to-asset ratios of selected stocks between 2020 and 2024.

Quantification of this relation is left as an exercise.\n\n## Efficiency Ratios\n\nEfficiency ratios measure how a company utilizes its assets and manages its operations. These metrics help us to understand operational performance and management effectiveness, particularly in how well a company converts its various assets into revenue and profit.\n\nAsset Turnover measures how efficiently a company uses its total assets to generate revenue:\n\n$$\\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Total Assets}}$$\n\nA higher ratio indicates more efficient use of assets in generating sales. However, this ratio typically varies significantly across industries - retail companies often have higher turnover ratios due to lower asset requirements, while manufacturing companies might show lower ratios due to substantial fixed asset investments. Such industry-specifics show the importance of cross-sectional comparisons, when making decisions based on data.\n\nInventory turnover indicates how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a period:\n\n$$\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{COGS}}{\\text{Inventory}}$$\n\nHigher inventory turnover suggests more efficient inventory management and working capital utilization. However, extremely high ratios might indicate potential stockouts, while very low ratios could suggest obsolete inventory or overinvestment in working capital.\n\nReceivables turnover measures how effectively a company collects payments from customers:\n\n$$\\text{Receivables Turnover} = \\frac{\\text{Revenue}}{\\text{Accounts Receivable}}$$\nA higher ratio indicates more efficient credit and collection processes, though this must be balanced against the potential impact on sales from overly restrictive credit policies.\n\nHere is how we can calculate these efficiency metrics across our sample of Dow Jones companies:\n\n::: {#51b49989 .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncombined_statements = (balance_sheet_statements\n  .get(\n    [\"symbol\", \"calendar_year\", \"label\", \"current_ratio\", \"quick_ratio\", \n     \"cash_ratio\", \"debt_to_equity\", \"debt_to_asset\", \"total_assets\", \n     \"total_equity\"]\n  )\n  .merge(\n    (income_statements\n      .get([\"symbol\", \"calendar_year\", \"interest_coverage\", \"revenue\", \n            \"cost_of_revenue\", \"selling_general_and_administrative_expenses\", \n            \"interest_expense\",\"gross_profit\", \"net_income\"])\n    ),\n    on=[\"symbol\", \"calendar_year\"],\n    how=\"left\"\n  )\n  .merge(\n    (cash_flow_statements\n      .get([\"symbol\", \"calendar_year\", \"inventory\", \"accounts_receivables\"])\n    ),\n    on=[\"symbol\", \"calendar_year\"],\n    how=\"left\"\n  )\n)\n\ncombined_statements = (combined_statements\n  .assign(\n    asset_turnover=lambda x: x[\"revenue\"] / x[\"total_assets\"],\n    inventory_turnover=lambda x: x[\"cost_of_revenue\"] / x[\"inventory\"],\n    receivables_turnover=lambda x: x[\"revenue\"] / x[\"accounts_receivables\"]\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe leave the visualization and interpretation of these figures as an exercise and move on the the last category of financial ratios. \n\n## Profitability Ratios\n\nProfitability ratios evaluate a company's ability to generate earnings relative to its revenue, assets, and equity. These metrics are fundamental to investment analysis as they directly measure a company's operational efficiency and financial success.\n\nThe gross margin measures what percentage of revenue remains after accounting for the direct costs of producing goods or services:\n\n$$\\text{Gross Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Revenue}}$$\n\nA higher gross margin indicates stronger pricing power or more efficient production processes. This metric is particularly useful for comparing companies within the same industry, as it reveals their relative efficiency in core operations before accounting for operating expenses and other costs.\n\nThe profit margin reveals what percentage of revenue ultimately becomes net income:\n\n$$\\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Revenue}}$$\nThis comprehensive profitability measure accounts for all costs, expenses, interest, and taxes. A higher profit margin suggests more effective overall cost management and stronger competitive position, though optimal margins vary significantly across industries.\n\nReturn on Equity (ROE) measures how efficiently a company uses shareholders' investments to generate profits:\n\n$$\\text{After-Tax ROE} = \\frac{\\text{Net Income}}{\\text{Total Equity}}$$\nThis metric is particularly important for investors as it directly measures the return on their invested capital (at least in terms of book value of equity). A higher ROE indicates more effective use of shareholders' equity, though it must be considered alongside leverage ratios since high debt levels can artificially inflate ROE.\n\nThe next code chunk calculates these profitability metrics for our sample of companies, allowing us to analyze how different firms convert their revenue into various levels of profit and return on investment.\n\n::: {#555794c5 .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncombined_statements = combined_statements.assign(\n  gross_margin=lambda x: x[\"gross_profit\"] / x[\"revenue\"],\n  profit_margin=lambda x: x[\"net_income\"] / x[\"revenue\"],\n  after_tax_roe=lambda x: x[\"net_income\"] / x[\"total_equity\"]\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n@fig-413 shows the patterns in gross margin trends among Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon between 2019 and 2023. \n\n::: {#cell-fig-413 .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ngross_margins = (combined_statements\n  .query(\"symbol in @selected_symbols\")\n)\n  \ngross_margins_figure = (\n  ggplot(\n    gross_margins,\n    aes(x=\"calendar_year\", y=\"gross_margin\", color=\"symbol\")\n  )\n  + geom_line()\n  + scale_y_continuous(labels=percent_format())\n  + labs(\n      x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\",\n      title=\"Gross margins for selected stocks between 2019 and 2023\"\n  )\n)\ngross_margins_figure.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Gross margins are based on financial statements provided through the FMP API.](financial-statement-analysis_files/figure-html/fig-413-output-1.png){#fig-413 width=2100 height=1500 fig-alt='Title: Gross margins for selected stocks between 2019 and 2023.

This analysis underscores the importance of considering multiple financial metrics together rather than in isolation when evaluating company performance.\n\n## Financial Ratios in Asset Pricing\n\nThe Fama-French five-factor model aims to explain stock returns by incorporating specific financial metrics ratios. We provide more details in [Replicating Fama-French Factors](replicating-fama-and-french-factors.qmd), but here is an intuitive overview:\n\n- Size: Calculated as the logarithm of a company’s market capitalization, which is the total market value of its outstanding shares. This factor captures the tendency for smaller firms to outperform larger ones over time.\n- Book-to-market ratio: Determined by dividing the company’s book equity by its market capitalization. A higher ratio indicates a 'value' stock, while a lower ratio suggests a 'growth'’' stock. This metric helps differentiate between undervalued and overvalued companies.\n- Profitability: Measured as the ratio of operating profit to book equity, where operating profit is calculated as revenue minus cost of goods sold (COGS), selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A), and interest expense. This factor assesses a company’s efficiency in generating profits from its equity base.\n- Investment: Calculated as the percentage change in total assets from the previous period. This factor reflects the company’s growth strategy, indicating whether it is investing aggressively or conservatively.\n\nWe can calculate these factors using the FMP API as follows:\n\n::: {#d2613112 .cell cache='true' execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nparams = {\"from\": \"2023-12-29\", \"to\": \"2023-12-29\"}\nmarket_cap = pd.concat(\n  [fmp_get(\n      resource=\"historical-market-capitalization\", symbol=x, params=params, to_pandas=True\n    ) for x in constituents],\n  ignore_index=True\n)\n\ncombined_statements_ff = (combined_statements\n  .query(\"calendar_year == 2023\")\n  .merge(market_cap, on=\"symbol\", how=\"left\")\n  .merge(\n    (balance_sheet_statements\n      .query(\"calendar_year == 2022\")\n      .get([\"symbol\", \"total_assets\"])\n      .rename(columns={\"total_assets\": \"total_assets_lag\"})\n    ),\n    on=\"symbol\", how=\"left\"\n  )\n  .assign(\n    size=lambda x: np.log(x[\"market_cap\"]),\n    book_to_market=lambda x: x[\"total_equity\"] / x[\"market_cap\"],\n    operating_profitability=lambda x: (\n        (x[\"revenue\"] - x[\"cost_of_revenue\"] - x[\"selling_general_and_administrative_expenses\"] - x[\"interest_expense\"])\n        / x[\"total_equity\"]\n    ),\n    investment=lambda x: x[\"total_assets\"] / x[\"total_assets_lag\"]\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n@fig-416 shows the ranks of our selected stocks for ratios used in the Fama-French model.

Download the financial statements for Netflix (NFLX) using the FMP API. Calculate its current ratio, quick ratio, and cash ratio for the past three years. Create a line plot showing how these liquidity ratios have evolved over time. How do Netflix's liquidity ratios compare to those of the technology companies discussed in this chapter?\n1. Select three companies from different industries in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Calculate their debt-to-equity ratios, debt-to-asset ratios, and interest coverage ratios. Create a visualization comparing these leverage metrics across the companies. Write a brief analysis explaining how and why leverage patterns differ across industries.\n1. For all Dow Jones constituents, calculate asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover. Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between asset turnover and profitability. Identify any outliers and explain potential reasons for their unusual performance. Which industries tend to show higher efficiency ratios? Why might this be the case?\n1. Revist the scatter plot of debt-to-asset ratios and interest coverages by adding a regression line and quantifying the relationship between the two variables.
