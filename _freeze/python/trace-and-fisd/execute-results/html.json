Code chunks and text might change over the next couple of months. We are always looking for feedback via [contact\\@tidy-finance.org](mailto:contact@tidy-finance.org). Meanwhile, you can find the complete R version [here](../r/index.qmd).\n:::\n\nIn this chapter, we dive into the US corporate bond market. Bond markets are far more diverse than stock markets, as most issuers have multiple bonds outstanding simultaneously with potentially very different indentures. This market segment is exciting due to its size (roughly 10 trillion USD outstanding), heterogeneity of issuers (as opposed to government bonds), market structure (mostly over-the-counter trades), and data availability. We introduce how to use bond characteristics from FISD and trade reports from TRACE and provide code to download and clean TRACE in Python.\n\nMany researchers study liquidity in the US corporate bond market [see, e.g., @bessembinder2006, @Edwards2007, and @Ohara2021, among many others]. We do not cover bond returns here, but you can compute them from TRACE data. Instead, we refer to studies on the topic such as @Bessembinder2008, @bai2019, and @kelly2020 and a survey by @Huang2021. \n\nThis chapter also draws on the resources provided by the project [Open Source Bond Asset Pricing](https://openbondassetpricing.com/) and their related publication @Dickerson2023. We encourage you to visit their website to check out the additional resources they provide. Moreover, WRDS provides bond returns computed from TRACE data at a monthly frequency.\\index{Corporate bonds}\n\nThe current chapter relies on this set of Python packages. \n\n::: {#45bba2ba .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\nimport httpimport\n\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom mizani.breaks import date_breaks\nfrom mizani.formatters import date_format, comma_format\n```\n:::\n\n\nCompared to previous chapters, we load `httpimport` [@httpimport] to source code provided in the public [gist.](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) Note that you should be careful with loading anything from the web via this method, and it is highly discouraged to use any unsecure \"HTTP\" links.\n\n## Bond Data from WRDS \n\nBoth bond databases we need are available on [WRDS](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/) to which we establish the `RPostgres` connection described in [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd). Additionally, we connect to our local `SQLite`-database to store the data we download.\\index{WRDS}\n\n::: {#6f510b65 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport os\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nload_dotenv()\n\nconnection_string = (\n  \"postgresql+psycopg2://\" + \n  os.getenv(\"WRDS_USER\") + \":\" + \n  os.getenv(\"WRDS_PASSWORD\") +\n  \"@wrds-pgdata.wharton.upenn.edu:9737/wrds\"\n)\nwrds = create_engine(connection_string, pool_pre_ping=True)\n\ntidy_finance = sqlite3.connect(\n  database=\"data/tidy_finance_python.sqlite\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Mergent FISD\n\nFor research on US corporate bonds, the Mergent Fixed Income Securities Database (FISD) is the primary resource for bond characteristics.\\index{Data!FISD} There is a [detailed manual](https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/1364/FixedIncome_Securities_Master_Database_User_Guide_v4.pdf) on WRDS, so we only cover the necessary subjects here. FISD data comes in two main variants, namely, centered on issuers or issues. In either case, the most useful identifiers are [CUSIPs.](https://www.cusip.com/index.html) 9-digit CUSIPs identify securities issued by issuers. The issuers can be identified from the first six digits of a security CUSIP, which is also called 6-digit CUSIP. Both stocks and bonds have CUSIPs.\\index{CUSIP} This connection would, in principle, allow matching them easily, but due to changing issuer details, this approach only yields small coverage.\n\nWe use the issue-centered version of FISD to identify the subset of US corporate bonds that meet the standard criteria [@bessembinder2006]. The WRDS table `fisd_mergedissue` contains most of the information we need on a 9-digit CUSIP level. Due to the diversity of corporate bonds, details in the indenture vary significantly. We focus on common bonds that make up the majority of trading volume in this market without diverging too much in indentures. \n\nThe following chunk connects to the data and selects the bond sample to remove certain bond types that are less commonly used [see, e.g., @Dick2012; @Ohara2021, among many others].\n\n::: {#c0f39834 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfisd_query = (\n  \"SELECT complete_cusip, maturity, offering_amt, \"\n         \"offering_date, dated_date, interest_frequency, \"\n         \"coupon, last_interest_date, issue_id, issuer_id \"\n    \"FROM fisd.fisd_mergedissue \"\n    \"WHERE security_level = 'SEN' \"\n          \"AND (slob = 'N' OR slob IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND security_pledge IS NULL \"              \n          \"AND (asset_backed = 'N' OR asset_backed IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND (defeased = 'N' OR defeased IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND defeased_date IS NULL \"\n          \"AND bond_type IN ('CDEB', 'CMTN', \"\n                            \"'CMTZ', 'CZ', 'USBN') \"\n          \"AND (pay_in_kind != 'Y' OR pay_in_kind IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND pay_in_kind_exp_date IS NULL \"\n          \"AND (yankee = 'N' OR yankee IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND (canadian = 'N' OR canadian IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND foreign_currency = 'N' \"\n          \"AND coupon_type IN ('F', 'Z') \"\n          \"AND fix_frequency IS NULL \"\n          \"AND coupon_change_indicator = 'N' \"\n          \"AND interest_frequency IN ('0', '1', '2', \"\n                                          \"'4', '12') \"\n          \"AND rule_144a = 'N' \"\n          \"AND (private_placement = 'N' OR \"\n               \"private_placement IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND defaulted = 'N' \"\n          \"AND filing_date IS NULL \"\n          \"AND settlement IS NULL \"\n          \"AND convertible = 'N' \"\n          \"AND exchange IS NULL \"\n          \"AND (putable = 'N' OR putable IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND (unit_deal = 'N' OR unit_deal IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND (exchangeable = 'N' OR exchangeable IS NULL) \"\n          \"AND perpetual = 'N' \"\n          \"AND (preferred_security = 'N' OR \"\n               \"preferred_security IS NULL)\"\n)\n\nfisd = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=fisd_query,\n    con=wrds,\n    dtype={\"complete_cusip\": str, \"interest_frequency\": str, \n           \"issue_id\": int, \"issuer_id\": int},\n    parse_dates={\"maturity\", \"offering_date\", \n                 \"dated_date\", \"last_interest_date\"}\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe also pull issuer information from `fisd_mergedissuer` regarding the industry and country of the firm that issued a particular bond. Then, we filter to include only US-domiciled firms' bonds. We match the data by `issuer_id`.\n\n::: {#c6e75a7c .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfisd_issuer_query = (\n  \"SELECT issuer_id, sic_code, country_domicile \"\n    \"FROM fisd.fisd_mergedissuer\"\n)\n\nfisd_issuer = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=fisd_issuer_query,\n    con=wrds,\n    dtype={\"issuer_id\": int, \"sic_code\": str, \n           \"country_domicile\": str}\n  )\n)\n\nfisd = (fisd\n  .merge(fisd_issuer, how=\"inner\", on=\"issuer_id\")\n  .query(\"country_domicile == 'USA'\")\n  .drop(columns=\"country_domicile\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we save the bond characteristics to our local database. This selection of bonds also constitutes the sample for which we will collect trade reports from TRACE below.\n\n::: {#65ff9efd .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n(fisd\n  .to_sql(name=\"fisd\", \n          con=tidy_finance, \n          if_exists=\"replace\",\n          index = False)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe FISD database also contains other data. The issue-based file contains information on covenants, i.e., restrictions included in bond indentures to limit specific actions by firms [e.g., @handler2021]. Moreover, FISD also provides information on bond ratings. We do not need either here.\n\n## TRACE\n\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) provides the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE).\\index{Data!TRACE} In TRACE, dealers that trade corporate bonds must report such trades individually. Hence, we observe trade messages in TRACE that contain information on the bond traded, the trade time, price, and volume. TRACE comes in two variants; standard and enhanced TRACE. We show how to download and clean enhanced TRACE as it contains uncapped volume, a crucial quantity missing in the standard distribution. Moreover, enhanced TRACE also provides information on the respective parties' roles and the direction of the trade report. These items become essential in cleaning the messages.\n\nWhy do we repeatedly talk about cleaning TRACE? Trade messages are submitted within a short time window after a trade is executed (less than 15 minutes). These messages can contain errors, and the reporters subsequently correct them or they cancel a trade altogether. The cleaning needs are described by @Dick2009 in detail, and @Dick2014 shows how to clean the enhanced TRACE data using SAS. We do not go into the cleaning steps here, since the code is lengthy and serves no educational purpose. However, downloading and cleaning enhanced TRACE data is straightforward with our setup.\n\nWe store code for cleaning enhanced TRACE with Python on the following Github [gist.](https://gist.github.com/patrick-weiss/86ddef6de978fbdfb22609a7840b5d8b) \\index{Github!Gist}. The appendix also contains the code for reference. We only need to source the code from the gist, which we can do with with the code below using `httpimport`. In the chunk, we explicitly load the necessary function interpreting the Gist as a module (i.e., you could also use it as a module and preceed the function calls with the module's name). Alternatively, you can also go to the gist, download it, and manually execute it. The `clean_enhanced_trace()` function takes a vector of CUSIPs, a connection to WRDS explained in [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd), and a start and end date, respectively. \n\n::: {#12007e48 .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ngist_url = \"https://gist.githubusercontent.com/patrick-weiss/86ddef6de978fbdfb22609a7840b5d8b/raw/084fccccb618375034dbd0afba65788d62a2affa/\"\n\nwith httpimport.remote_repo(gist_url):\n  from clean_enhanced_TRACE_python import clean_enhanced_trace\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe TRACE database is considerably large. Therefore, we only download subsets of data at once. Specifying too many CUSIPs over a long time horizon will result in very long download times and a potential failure due to the size of the request to WRDS. The size limit depends on many parameters, and we cannot give you a guideline here. For the applications in this book, we need data around the Paris Agreement in December 2015 and download the data in sets of 1000 bonds, which we define below.\\index{Paris (Climate) Agreement}\n\n::: {#e0193c3a .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfisd_cusips = list(fisd[\"complete_cusip\"].unique())\n\nbatch_size = 100\nbatches = np.ceil(len(fisd_cusips) / batch_size).astype(int)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we run a loop in the same style as in [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd) where we download daily returns from CRSP. For each of the CUSIP sets defined above, we call the cleaning function and save the resulting output. We add new data to the existing table for batch two and all following batches.\n\n::: {#dc639814 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfor j in range(1, batches + 1):\n  \n  cusip_chunk = fisd_cusips[\n    ((j - 1) * batch_size):(min(j * batch_size, len(fisd_cusips)))\n  ]\n\n  cusip_str = \"('\" + \"', '\".join(cusip_chunk) + \"')\"\n  \n  trace_enhanced_sub = clean_enhanced_trace(\n    cusips=cusip_str,\n    connection=wrds, \n    start_date=\"'01/01/2014'\", \n    end_date=\"'11/30/2016'\"\n  )\n  \n  if not trace_enhanced_sub.empty:\n    if j == 1:\n      trace_enhanced_sub.to_sql(\n        name=\"trace_enhanced\", \n        con=tidy_finance, \n        if_exists=\"replace\", \n        index=False\n      )\n    else:\n      trace_enhanced_sub.to_sql(\n        name=\"trace_enhanced\", \n        con=tidy_finance,\n        if_exists=\"append\", \n        index=False\n      )\n    \n  print(f\"Chunk {j} out of {batches} done ({(j / batches) * 100:.2f}%)\\n\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Insights into Corporate Bonds\n\nWhile many news outlets readily provide information on stocks and the underlying firms, corporate bonds are not covered frequently. Additionally, the TRACE database contains trade-level information, potentially new to students. Therefore, we provide you with some insights by showing some summary statistics.\\index{Summary statistics}\n\nWe start by looking into the number of bonds outstanding over time and compare it to the number of bonds traded in our sample. First, we compute the number of bonds outstanding for each quarter around the Paris Agreement from 2014 to 2016. \n\n::: {#3bac3da5 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndates = pd.date_range(\n  start='2014-01-01', \n  end='2016-11-30', \n  freq='Q'\n)\n\nbonds_outstanding = (pd.DataFrame({\n      'date': dates\n  })\n  .merge(fisd[['complete_cusip']], how='cross')\n  .merge(fisd[['complete_cusip', 'offering_date', 'maturity']],\n         on='complete_cusip', how='left')\n  .assign(\n    offering_date = lambda x: x[\"offering_date\"].dt.floor('D'),\n    maturity = lambda x: x[\"maturity\"].dt.floor('D')\n  )\n  .query(\n    \"date >= offering_date & date <= maturity\"\n  )\n  .groupby('date')\n  .size()\n  .reset_index(name='count')\n  .assign(\n    type = \"Outstanding\"\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we look at the bonds traded each quarter in the same period. Notice that we load the complete trace table from our database, as we only have a single part of it in the environment from the download loop from above.\n\n::: {#f27bab6b .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntrace_enhanced = (pd.read_sql_query(\n    sql=(\"SELECT cusip_id, trd_exctn_dt, rptd_pr, \" \n                \"entrd_vol_qt, yld_pt \" \n            \"FROM trace_enhanced\"),\n    con=tidy_finance,\n    parse_dates={\"trd_exctn_dt\"}\n  )\n)\n\nbonds_traded = (trace_enhanced\n  .assign(\n    date = lambda x: (\n      (x[\"trd_exctn_dt\"] - pd.offsets.MonthBegin(1))\n        .dt.to_period(\"Q\").dt.start_time\n    )\n  )\n  .groupby(\"date\", as_index=False)\n  .aggregate(count=(\"cusip_id\", \"nunique\"))\n  .assign(\n    type = \"Traded\"\n  )\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we plot the two time series in @fig-401.\n\n::: {#cell-fig-401 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbonds_combined = pd.concat(\n  [bonds_outstanding, bonds_traded], \n  ignore_index=True\n)\n\nbonds_figure = (\n  ggplot(bonds_combined, \n         aes(x=\"date\", y=\"count\", \n             color=\"type\", linetype=\"type\")) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"\", y=\"\", color=\"\", linetype=\"\",\n    title=\"Number of bonds outstanding and traded each quarter\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_datetime(breaks=date_breaks(\"1 year\"), \n                   labels=date_format(\"%Y\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels=comma_format())\n)\nbonds_figure.draw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=24}\n![The number of corporate bonds outstanding each quarter as reported by Mergent FISD and the number of traded bonds from enhanced TRACE between 2014 and end of 2016.](trace-and-fisd_files/figure-html/fig-401-output-1.png){#fig-401 fig-alt='Title: Number of bonds outstanding and traded each quarter.

During our sample period of trade data, we see that the fraction of bonds trading each quarter is roughly 60%. The relatively small number of traded bonds means that many bonds do not trade through an entire quarter. This lack of trading activity illustrates the generally low level of liquidity in the corporate bond market, where it can be hard to trade specific bonds. \nDoes this lack of liquidity mean that corporate bond markets are irrelevant in terms of their size? With over 7,500 traded bonds each quarter, it is hard to say that the market is small. However, let us also investigate the characteristics of issued corporate bonds.

Start by looking at the number of bonds traded each day in a graph similar to the one above. How many bonds trade on more than 75% of trading days? \n1. WRDS provides more information from Mergent FISD such as ratings in the table `fisd_ratings`. Download the ratings table and plot the distribution of ratings for the different rating providers.
