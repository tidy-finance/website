You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with R** [here](../r/difference-in-differences.qmd).\n:::\n\nIn this chapter, we illustrate the concept of *difference in differences* (DD) estimators by evaluating the effects of climate change regulation on the pricing of bonds across firms. DD estimators are typically used to recover the treatment effects of natural or quasi-natural experiments that trigger sharp changes in the environment of a specific group. Instead of looking at differences in just one group (e.g., the effect in the treated group), DD investigates the treatment effects by looking at the difference between differences in two groups. Such experiments are usually exploited to address endogeneity concerns [e.g., @RobertsWhited2013]. The identifying assumption is that the outcome variable would change equally in both groups without the treatment. This assumption is also often referred to as the assumption of parallel trends. Moreover, we would ideally also want a random assignment to the treatment and control groups. Due to lobbying or other activities, this randomness is often violated in (financial) economics.\\index{Difference in differences}\n\nIn the context of our setting, we investigate the impact of the Paris Agreement (PA), signed on December 12, 2015, on the bond yields of polluting firms. We first estimate the treatment effect of the agreement using panel regression techniques that we discuss in [Fixed Effects and Clustered Standard Errors](fixed-effects-and-clustered-standard-errors.qmd). We then present two methods to illustrate the treatment effect over time graphically. Although we demonstrate that the treatment effect of the agreement is anticipated by bond market participants well in advance, the techniques we present below can also be applied to many other settings.\\index{Paris (Climate) Agreement}\n\nThe approach we use here replicates the results of @Seltzer2022 partly. Specifically, we borrow their industry definitions for grouping firms into green and brown types. Overall, the literature on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) effects in corporate bond markets is already large but continues to grow (for recent examples, see, e.g., @Halling2021, @Handler2022, @Huynh2021, among many others).\n\nThe current chapter relies on this set of Python packages. \n\n::: {#d5c8d07e .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport sqlite3\nimport pyfixest as pf\n\nfrom plotnine import *\nfrom scipy.stats import norm\nfrom mizani.breaks import date_breaks\nfrom mizani.formatters import date_format\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n\n            <div id=\"B1DlYu\"></div>\n            <script type=\"text/javascript\" data-lets-plot-script=\"library\">\n                if(!window.letsPlotCallQueue) {\n                    window.letsPlotCallQueue = [];\n                };

Moreover, we only consider transactions with reported prices `rptd_pr` larger than 25 (to exclude bonds that are close to default) and only bond-day observations with more than five trades on a corresponding day (to exclude prices based on too few, potentially non-representative transactions).\\index{Yield aggregation} \\index{Returns!Bonds}\n\n::: {#ea351664 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntrace_enhanced = (trace_enhanced\n  .query(\"rptd_pr > 25\")\n  .assign(weight=lambda x: x[\"entrd_vol_qt\"]*x[\"rptd_pr\"])\n  .assign(weighted_yield=lambda x: x[\"weight\"]*x[\"yld_pt\"])\n)\n\ntrace_aggregated = (trace_enhanced\n  .groupby([\"cusip_id\", \"trd_exctn_dt\"])\n  .aggregate(\n    weighted_yield_sum=(\"weighted_yield\", \"sum\"),\n    weight_sum=(\"weight\", \"sum\"),\n    trades=(\"rptd_pr\", \"count\")\n  )\n  .reset_index()\n  .assign(avg_yield=lambda x: x[\"weighted_yield_sum\"]/x[\"weight_sum\"])\n  .dropna(subset=[\"avg_yield\"])\n  .query(\"trades >= 5\")\n  .assign(trd_exctn_dt=lambda x: pd.to_datetime(x[\"trd_exctn_dt\"]))\n  .assign(date=lambda x: x[\"trd_exctn_dt\"]-pd.offsets.MonthBegin())\n)\n\ndate_index = (trace_aggregated\n  .groupby([\"cusip_id\", \"date\"])[\"trd_exctn_dt\"]\n  .idxmax()\n)\n\ntrace_aggregated = (trace_aggregated\n  .loc[date_index]\n  .get([\"cusip_id\", \"date\", \"avg_yield\"])\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBy combining the bond-specific information from Mergent FISD for our bond sample with the aggregated TRACE data, we arrive at the main sample for our analysis.\n\n::: {#00a8d79f .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbonds_panel = (bonds\n  .merge(trace_aggregated, how=\"inner\", on=\"cusip_id\")\n  .dropna()\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nBefore we can run the first regression, we need to define the `treated` indicator,^[Note that by using a generic name here, everybody can replace ours with their sample data and run the code to produce standard regression tables and illustrations.] which is the product of the `post_period` (i.e., all months after the signing of the PA) and the `polluter` indicator defined above.\\index{Regression!Fixed effects} \n\n::: {#cc59a884 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbonds_panel = (bonds_panel\n  .assign(\n    post_period=lambda x: (\n      x[\"date\"] >= (treatment_date-pd.offsets.MonthBegin())\n    )\n  )\n  .assign(treated=lambda x: x[\"polluter\"] & x[\"post_period\"])\n  .assign(date_cat=lambda x: pd.Categorical(x[\"date\"], ordered=True))\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs usual, we tabulate summary statistics of the variables that enter the regression to check the validity of our variable definitions.\\index{Summary statistics}\n\n::: {#01946d4e .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbonds_panel_summary = (bonds_panel\n  .melt(var_name=\"measure\",\n        value_vars=[\"avg_yield\", \"time_to_maturity\", \"log_offering_amt\"])\n  .groupby(\"measure\")\n  .describe(percentiles=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])\n)\nnp.round(bonds_panel_summary, 2)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=9}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead tr th {\n        text-align: left;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead tr:last-of-type th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th colspan=\"8\" halign=\"left\">value</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th></th>\n      <th>count</th>\n      <th>mean</th>\n      <th>std</th>\n      <th>min</th>\n      <th>5%</th>\n      <th>50%</th>\n      <th>95%</th>\n      <th>max</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>measure</th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n      <th></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>avg_yield</th>\n      <td>127539.0</td>\n      <td>4.08</td>\n      <td>4.21</td>\n      <td>0.06</td>\n      <td>1.27</td>\n      <td>3.38</td>\n      <td>8.11</td>\n      <td>127.97</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>log_offering_amt</th>\n      <td>127539.0</td>\n      <td>13.27</td>\n      <td>0.82</td>\n      <td>4.64</td>\n      <td>12.21</td>\n      <td>13.22</td>\n      <td>14.51</td>\n      <td>16.52</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>time_to_maturity</th>\n      <td>127539.0</td>\n      <td>8.55</td>\n      <td>8.42</td>\n      <td>1.01</td>\n      <td>1.50</td>\n      <td>5.81</td>\n      <td>27.41</td>\n      <td>100.70</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Panel Regressions\n\nThe PA is a legally binding international treaty on climate change. It was adopted by 196 parties at COP 21 in Paris on December 12, 2015 and entered into force on November 4, 2016. The PA obliges developed countries to support efforts to build clean, climate-resilient futures. One may thus hypothesize that adopting climate-related policies may affect financial markets. To measure the magnitude of this effect, we first run an ordinary least square (OLS) regression without fixed effects where we include the `treated`, `post_period`, and `polluter` dummies, as well as the bond-specific characteristics `log_offering_amt` and `time_to_maturity`. This simple model assumes that there are essentially two periods (before and after the PA) and two groups (polluters and non-polluters). Nonetheless, it should indicate whether polluters have higher yields following the PA compared to non-polluters.\\index{Yields}\\index{Regression!Panel}\n\nThe second model follows the typical DD regression approach by including individual (`cusip_id`) and time (`date`) fixed effects. In this model, we do not include any other variables from the simple model because the fixed effects subsume them, and we observe the coefficient of our main variable of interest: `treated`. \n\n::: {#26bfaac6 .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmodel_without_fe = pf.feols(\n  \"avg_yield ~ treated + post_period + polluter + log_offering_amt + time_to_maturity\",\n  vcov = \"iid\",\n  data = bonds_panel\n)\n\nmodel_with_fe = pf.feols(\n  \"avg_yield ~ treated | cusip_id + date\",\n  vcov = \"iid\",\n  data = bonds_panel\n)\n\npf.etable([model_without_fe, model_with_fe], coef_fmt = \"b (t)\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n                                 est1               est2\n----------------  -------------------  -----------------\ndepvar                      avg_yield          avg_yield\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept          10.733*** (57.057)\ntreated              0.453*** (9.135)  0.975*** (30.121)\npost_period        -0.178*** (-6.040)\npolluter            0.486*** (15.426)\nlog_offering_amt  -0.550*** (-38.992)\ntime_to_maturity    0.058*** (41.526)\n--------------------------------------------------------\ncusip_id                            -                  x\ndate                                -                  x\n--------------------------------------------------------\nR2                              0.032              0.648\nS.E. type                         iid                iid\nObservations                   127539             127539\n--------------------------------------------------------\nSignificance levels: * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001\nFormat of coefficient cell:\nCoefficient (t-stats)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBoth models indicate that polluters have significantly higher yields after the PA than non-polluting firms. Note that the magnitude of the `treated` coefficient varies considerably across models. \n\n## Visualizing Parallel Trends\n\nEven though the regressions above indicate that there is an impact of the PA on bond yields of polluters, the tables do not tell us anything about the dynamics of the treatment effect. In particular, the models provide no indication about whether the crucial *parallel trends* assumption is valid. This assumption requires that in the absence of treatment, the difference between the two groups is constant over time. Although there is no well-defined statistical test for this assumption, visual inspection typically provides a good indication.\\index{Parallel trends assumption}\n\nTo provide such visual evidence, we revisit the simple OLS model and replace the `treated` and `post_period` indicators with month dummies for each group. This approach estimates the average yield change of both groups for each period and provides corresponding confidence intervals. Plotting the coefficient estimates for both groups around the treatment date shows us the dynamics of our panel data.\\index{Graph!Difference in differences graph} \n\n::: {#cell-fig-1301 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmodel_without_fe_time = pf.feols(\n  \"avg_yield ~ polluter + date*polluter + time_to_maturity + log_offering_amt\",\n  vcov = \"iid\",\n  data = bonds_panel.assign(date = lambda x: x[\"date\"].astype(str))\n)\n\nmodel_without_fe_coefs = (pd.DataFrame({\n    \"estimate\": model_without_fe_time.coef(),\n    \"std_error\": model_without_fe_time.se()\n  })\n  .reset_index(names=\"term\")\n  .query(\"term.str.contains('date')\")\n  .assign(\n    treatment=lambda x: x[\"term\"].str.contains(\":polluter\"),\n    date=lambda x: x[\"term\"].str.extract(r\"date\\[T\\.(\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2})\\]\"),\n    ci_up=lambda x: x[\"estimate\"]+norm.ppf(0.975)*x[\"std_error\"],\n    ci_low=lambda x: x[\"estimate\"]+norm.ppf(0.025)*x[\"std_error\"]\n  )\n)\n\nmodel_without_fe_figure = (\n  ggplot(\n    model_without_fe_coefs, \n    aes(x=\"date\", y=\"estimate\", color=\"treatment\",\n        linetype=\"treatment\", shape=\"treatment\")\n  )\n  + geom_vline(xintercept=pd.to_datetime(treatment_date) -\n               pd.offsets.MonthBegin(), linetype=\"dashed\")\n  + geom_hline(yintercept=0, linetype=\"dashed\")\n  + geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=\"ci_low\", ymax=\"ci_up\"), alpha=0.5)\n  + geom_point()\n  + guides(linetype=None)\n  + labs(\n      x=\"\", y=\"Yield\", shape=\"Polluter?\", color=\"Polluter?\",\n      title=\"Polluters respond stronger than green firms\"\n    )\n  + scale_linetype_manual(values=[\"solid\", \"dashed\"])\n  + scale_x_datetime(breaks=date_breaks(\"1 year\"), labels=date_format(\"%Y\")) \n)\nmodel_without_fe_figure.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![The figure shows the coefficient estimates and 95 percent confidence intervals for OLS regressions estimating the treatment effect of the Paris Agreement on bond yields (in percent) for polluters and non-polluters.

To perform this estimation, we need to replace the `treated` indicator with separate time dummies for the polluters, each marking a one-month period relative to the treatment date.\\index{Graph!Difference in differences}\n\n::: {#84c75500 .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nbonds_panel_alt = (bonds_panel\n  .assign(\n    diff_to_treatment=lambda x: (\n      np.round(\n        ((x[\"date\"]-(treatment_date- \n            pd.offsets.MonthBegin())).dt.days/365)*12, 0\n      ).astype(int)\n    )\n  )\n)\n\nvariables = (bonds_panel_alt\n  .get([\"diff_to_treatment\", \"date\"])\n  .drop_duplicates()\n  .sort_values(\"date\")\n  .copy()\n  .assign(variable_name=np.nan)\n  .reset_index(drop=True)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the next code chunk, we assemble the model formula and regress the monthly yields on the set of time dummies and `cusip_id` and `date` fixed effects. \n\n::: {#5c5f1be1 .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nformula = \"avg_yield ~ 1 + \"\n\nfor j in range(variables.shape[0]):\n    if variables[\"diff_to_treatment\"].iloc[j] != 0:\n        old_names=list(bonds_panel_alt.columns)\n        \n        bonds_panel_alt[\"new_var\"] = (\n          bonds_panel_alt[\"diff_to_treatment\"] == \n            variables[\"diff_to_treatment\"].iloc[j]\n        ) & bonds_panel_alt[\"polluter\"]\n        \n        diff_to_treatment_value=variables[\"diff_to_treatment\"].iloc[j]\n        direction=\"lag\" if diff_to_treatment_value < 0 else \"lead\"\n        abs_diff_to_treatment=int(abs(diff_to_treatment_value))\n        new_var_name=f\"{direction}{abs_diff_to_treatment}\"\n        variables.at[j, \"variable_name\"]=new_var_name\n        bonds_panel_alt[new_var_name]=bonds_panel_alt[\"new_var\"]\n        formula += (f\" + {new_var_name}\" if j > 0 else new_var_name)\n\nformula = formula + \" | cusip_id + date \"\n\nmodel_with_fe_time = pf.feols(\n  formula,\n  vcov = \"iid\",\n  data = bonds_panel_alt\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe then collect the regression results into a dataframe that contains the estimates and corresponding 95 percent confidence intervals.

Yields only marginally increase after the signing of the agreement. However, as opposed to the simple model, we do not see a complete reversal back to the pre-agreement level. Yields of polluters stay at a significantly higher level even one year after the signing.\n\nNotice that during the year after the PA was signed, the 45th president of the United States was elected (on November 8, 2016). During his campaign there were some indications of intentions to withdraw the US from the PA, which ultimately happened on November 4, 2020. Hence, reversal effects are potentially driven by these actions.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1. The 46th president of the US rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021. Repeat the difference in differences analysis for the day of his election victory. Note that you will also have to download new TRACE data. How did polluters' yields react to this action?\n2. Based on the exercise on ratings in [TRACE and FISD](trace-and-fisd.qmd), include ratings as a control variable in the analysis above. Do the results change?\n\n",
