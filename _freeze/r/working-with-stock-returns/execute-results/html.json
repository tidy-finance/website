You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with Python** [here](../python/working-with-stock-returns.qmd).\n:::\n\nThe main aim of this chapter is to familiarize yourself with the `tidyverse` for working with stock market data. We focus on downloading and visualizing stock data from data provider Yahoo Finance.\\index{tidyverse}\n\nAt the start of each session, we load the required R packages. Throughout the entire book, we always use the `tidyverse` [@Wickham2019] package. In this chapter, we also load the `tidyfinance` package to download stock price data. This package provides a convenient wrapper for various quantitative functions compatible with the `tidyverse` and our book. Finally, the package `scales` [@scales] provides nice formatting for axis labels in visualizations.\n\nYou typically have to install a package once before you can load it into your active R session. In case you have not done this yet, call, for instance, `install.packages(\"tidyfinance\")`.\\index{tidyfinance}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(tidyfinance)\nlibrary(scales)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Downloading Data\n\nWe first download daily prices for one stock symbol, e.g., the Apple stock (*AAPL*), directly from the data provider Yahoo Finance. To download the data, you can use the function `download_data`. In case this is the first time you use the package `tidyfinance`, you may be asked once to install some additional packages in the process of downloading the data. If you do not know how to use it, make sure you read the help file by calling `?download_data`. We especially recommend taking a look at the examples section of the documentation. \n\nIn the following code, we request daily data from the beginning of 2000 to the end of the last year, which is a period of more than 20 years.\\index{Stock prices}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprices <- download_data(\n  type = \"stock_prices\",\n  symbols = \"AAPL\",\n  start_date = \"2000-01-01\",\n  end_date = \"2024-12-31\"\n)\nprices\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6,288 × 8\n  symbol date          volume  open   low  high close adjusted_close\n  <chr>  <date>         <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>          <dbl>\n1 AAPL   2000-01-03 535796800 0.936 0.908 1.00  0.999          0.839\n2 AAPL   2000-01-04 512377600 0.967 0.903 0.988 0.915          0.769\n3 AAPL   2000-01-05 778321600 0.926 0.920 0.987 0.929          0.780\n4 AAPL   2000-01-06 767972800 0.948 0.848 0.955 0.848          0.712\n5 AAPL   2000-01-07 460734400 0.862 0.853 0.902 0.888          0.746\n# ℹ 6,283 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\\index{Data!Yahoo Finance} `download_data(type = \"stock_prices\")` downloads stock market data from Yahoo Finance. The function returns a data frame with eight self-explanatory columns: `symbol`, `date`, the daily `volume` (in the number of traded shares), the market prices at the `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, and the `adjusted` price in USD. The adjusted prices are corrected for anything that might affect the stock price after the market closes, e.g., stock splits and dividends. These actions affect the quoted prices, but they have no direct impact on the investors who hold the stock. Therefore, we often rely on adjusted prices when it comes to analyzing the returns an investor would have earned by holding the stock continuously.\\index{Stock price adjustments}\n\nNext, we use the `ggplot2` package [@ggplot2] to visualize the time series of adjusted prices in @fig-100. This package takes care of visualization tasks based on the principles of the grammar of graphics [@Wilkinson2012].\\index{Graph!Time series}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprices |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = adjusted_close)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"Apple stock prices between beginning of 2000 and end of 2024\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Prices are in USD, adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits.](working-with-stock-returns_files/figure-html/fig-100-1.png){#fig-100 fig-alt='Title: Apple stock prices between beginning of 2000 and end of 2023.

Note that the first entry naturally contains a missing value (`NA`) because there is no previous price.\\index{Missing value} Obviously, the use of `lag()` would be meaningless if the time series is not ordered by ascending dates.\\index{Lag observations} The command `arrange()` provides a convenient way to order observations in the correct way for our application. If you want to order observations by descending values, you could, for instance, use `arrange(desc(ret))`. Always check that your data has the desired structure before calling `lag()` or similar functions.\n\nFor the upcoming examples, we remove missing values as these would require separate treatment for many applications. For example, missing values can affect sums and averages by reducing the number of valid data points if not properly accounted for. In general, always ensure you understand why `NA` values occur and carefully examine if you can simply get rid of these observations.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturns <- returns |>\n  drop_na(ret)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram in @fig-101. \\index{Graph!Histogram} Additionally, we draw a dashed line that indicates the historical five percent quantile of the daily returns to the histogram, which is a crude proxy for the worst possible return of the stock with a probability of at most five percent. This quantile is closely connected to the (historical) value-at-risk, a risk measure commonly monitored by regulators.\\index{Value-at-risk} We refer to @Tsay2010 for a more thorough introduction to the stylized facts of financial returns.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nquantile_05 <- quantile(returns$ret, probs = 0.05)\nreturns |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = ret)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = quantile_05),\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"Distribution of daily Apple stock returns\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The dotted vertical line indicates the historical five percent quantile.](working-with-stock-returns_files/figure-html/fig-101-1.png){#fig-101 fig-alt='Title: Distribution of daily Apple stock returns in percent.

The vertical line indicates that the historical five percent quantile of daily returns was around negative three percent.' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere, `bins = 100` determines the number of bins used in the illustration and, hence, implicitly sets the width of the bins. Before proceeding, make sure you understand how to use the geom `geom_vline()` to add a dashed line that indicates the historical five percent quantile of the daily returns. Before proceeding with *any* data, a typical task is to compute and analyze the summary statistics for the main variables of interest.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturns |>\n  summarize(across(\n    ret,\n    list(\n      daily_mean = mean,\n      daily_sd = sd,\n      daily_min = min,\n      daily_max = max\n    )\n  ))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n  ret_daily_mean ret_daily_sd ret_daily_min ret_daily_max\n           <dbl>        <dbl>         <dbl>         <dbl>\n1        0.00122       0.0244        -0.519         0.139\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the maximum *daily* return was 13.905 percent. Perhaps not surprisingly, the average daily return is close to but slightly above 0. In line with the illustration above, the large losses on the day with the minimum returns indicate a strong asymmetry in the distribution of returns.\n\nYou can also compute these summary statistics for each year individually by imposing `group_by(year = year(date))`, where the call `year(date)` returns the year. More specifically, the few lines of code below compute the summary statistics from above for individual groups of data defined by the values of the column year. The summary statistics, therefore, allow an eyeball analysis of the time-series dynamics of the daily return distribution.\\index{Summary statistics}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturns |>\n  group_by(year = year(date)) |>\n  summarize(across(\n    ret,\n    list(\n      daily_mean = mean,\n      daily_sd = sd,\n      daily_min = min,\n      daily_max = max\n    ),\n    .names = \"{.fn}\"\n  )) |>\n  print(n = Inf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 25 × 5\n    year daily_mean daily_sd daily_min daily_max\n   <dbl>      <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1  2000 -0.00346     0.0549   -0.519     0.137 \n 2  2001  0.00233     0.0393   -0.172     0.129 \n 3  2002 -0.00121     0.0305   -0.150     0.0846\n 4  2003  0.00186     0.0234   -0.0814    0.113 \n 5  2004  0.00470     0.0255   -0.0558    0.132 \n 6  2005  0.00349     0.0245   -0.0921    0.0912\n 7  2006  0.000949    0.0243   -0.0633    0.118 \n 8  2007  0.00366     0.0238   -0.0702    0.105 \n 9  2008 -0.00265     0.0367   -0.179     0.139 \n10  2009  0.00382     0.0214   -0.0502    0.0676\n11  2010  0.00183     0.0169   -0.0496    0.0769\n12  2011  0.00104     0.0165   -0.0559    0.0589\n13  2012  0.00130     0.0186   -0.0644    0.0887\n14  2013  0.000472    0.0180   -0.124     0.0514\n15  2014  0.00145     0.0136   -0.0799    0.0820\n16  2015  0.0000199   0.0168   -0.0612    0.0574\n17  2016  0.000575    0.0147   -0.0657    0.0650\n18  2017  0.00164     0.0111   -0.0388    0.0610\n19  2018 -0.0000573   0.0181   -0.0663    0.0704\n20  2019  0.00266     0.0165   -0.0996    0.0683\n21  2020  0.00281     0.0294   -0.129     0.120 \n22  2021  0.00131     0.0158   -0.0417    0.0539\n23  2022 -0.000970    0.0225   -0.0587    0.0890\n24  2023  0.00168     0.0128   -0.0480    0.0469\n25  2024  0.00120     0.0143   -0.0482    0.0726\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn case you wonder, the additional argument `.names = \"{.fn}\"` in `across()` determines how to name the output columns. It acts as a placeholder that gets replaced by the name of the function being applied (e.g., mean, sd, min, max) when creating new column names. The specification is rather flexible and allows almost arbitrary column names, which can be useful for reporting. The `print()` function controls the R console's output options.\n\n## Scaling Up the Analysis\n\nAs a next step, we generalize the previous code so that all computations can handle an arbitrary number of symbols (e.g., all constituents of an index). Following tidy principles, it is quite easy to download the data, plot the price time series, and tabulate the summary statistics for an arbitrary number of assets.\n\nThis is where the `tidyverse` magic starts: Tidy data makes it extremely easy to generalize the computations from before to as many assets or groups as you like. The following code takes any number of symbols, e.g., `symbol <- c(\"AAPL\", \"MMM\", \"BA\")`, and automates the download as well as the plot of the price time series. In the end, we create the table of summary statistics for all assets at once. For this example, we analyze data from all current constituents of the [Dow Jones Industrial Average index.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average)\\index{Data!Dow Jones Index}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsymbols <- download_data(\n  type = \"constituents\", \n  index = \"Dow Jones Industrial Average\"\n) \nsymbols\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 30 × 5\n  symbol name                    location           exchange currency\n  <chr>  <chr>                   <chr>              <chr>    <chr>   \n1 GS     GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC Vereinigte Staaten New Yor… USD     \n2 CAT    CATERPILLAR INC         Vereinigte Staaten New Yor… USD     \n3 MSFT   MICROSOFT CORP          Vereinigte Staaten NASDAQ   USD     \n4 HD     HOME DEPOT INC          Vereinigte Staaten New Yor… USD     \n5 AXP    AMERICAN EXPRESS        Vereinigte Staaten New Yor… USD     \n# ℹ 25 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nConveniently, `tidyfinance` provides the functionality to get all stock prices from an index for a specific point in time with a single call.\\index{Exchange!NASDAQ}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprices_daily <- download_data(\n  type = \"stock_prices\",\n  symbols = symbols$symbol,\n  start_date = \"2000-01-01\",\n  end_date = \"2023-12-31\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting data frame contains 177925 daily observations for GS, CAT, MSFT, HD, AXP, SHW, AMGN, V, MCD, IBM, JPM, UNH, TRV, AAPL, AMZN, BA, JNJ, HON, CRM, NVDA, CVX, MMM, PG, WMT, DIS, MRK, CSCO, KO, NKE, VZ different stocks. @fig-102 illustrates the time series of the downloaded *adjusted* prices for each of the constituents of the Dow index.

All we needed to do to illustrate all stock symbols simultaneously is to include `color = symbol` in the `ggplot` aesthetics. In this way, we generate a separate line for each symbol. Of course, there are simply too many lines on this graph to identify the individual stocks properly, but it illustrates our point of how to generalize a specific analysis to an arbitrage number of subjects quite well.\n\nThe same holds for stock returns. Before computing the returns, we use `group_by(symbol)` such that the `mutate()` command is performed for each symbol individually. The same logic also applies to the computation of summary statistics: `group_by(symbol)` is the key to aggregating the time series into symbol-specific variables of interest.\\index{Summary statistics}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturns_daily <- prices_daily |>\n  group_by(symbol) |>\n  mutate(ret = adjusted_close / lag(adjusted_close) - 1) |>\n  select(symbol, date, ret) |>\n  drop_na(ret)\n\nreturns_daily |>\n  group_by(symbol) |>\n  summarize(across(\n    ret,\n    list(\n      daily_mean = mean,\n      daily_sd = sd,\n      daily_min = min,\n      daily_max = max\n    ),\n    .names = \"{.fn}\"\n  )) |>\n  print(n = Inf)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 30 × 5\n   symbol daily_mean daily_sd daily_min daily_max\n   <chr>       <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>\n 1 AAPL     0.00122    0.0247    -0.519     0.139\n 2 AMGN     0.000493   0.0194    -0.134     0.151\n 3 AMZN     0.00107    0.0315    -0.248     0.345\n 4 AXP      0.000544   0.0227    -0.176     0.219\n 5 BA       0.000628   0.0222    -0.238     0.243\n 6 CAT      0.000724   0.0203    -0.145     0.147\n 7 CRM      0.00119    0.0266    -0.271     0.260\n 8 CSCO     0.000322   0.0234    -0.162     0.244\n 9 CVX      0.000511   0.0175    -0.221     0.227\n10 DIS      0.000414   0.0194    -0.184     0.160\n11 GS       0.000557   0.0229    -0.190     0.265\n12 HD       0.000544   0.0192    -0.287     0.141\n13 HON      0.000497   0.0191    -0.174     0.282\n14 IBM      0.000297   0.0163    -0.155     0.120\n15 JNJ      0.000379   0.0121    -0.158     0.122\n16 JPM      0.000606   0.0238    -0.207     0.251\n17 KO       0.000318   0.0131    -0.101     0.139\n18 MCD      0.000536   0.0145    -0.159     0.181\n19 MMM      0.000363   0.0151    -0.129     0.126\n20 MRK      0.000371   0.0166    -0.268     0.130\n21 MSFT     0.000573   0.0193    -0.156     0.196\n22 NKE      0.000708   0.0193    -0.198     0.155\n23 NVDA     0.00175    0.0376    -0.352     0.424\n24 PG       0.000362   0.0133    -0.302     0.120\n25 SHW      0.000860   0.0180    -0.208     0.153\n26 TRV      0.000555   0.0181    -0.208     0.256\n27 UNH      0.000948   0.0196    -0.186     0.348\n28 V        0.000933   0.0185    -0.136     0.150\n29 VZ       0.000238   0.0151    -0.118     0.146\n30 WMT      0.000323   0.0148    -0.114     0.117\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that you are now also equipped with all tools to download price data for *each* symbol listed in the S&P 500 index with the same number of lines of code.

For example, stock prices are typically recorded daily, while macroeconomic indicators such as GDP or inflation are reported monthly or quarterly. Additionally, some datasets are recorded only when transactions occur, resulting in irregular timestamps. To compare data meaningfully, we have to align different frequencies appropriately. For example, to compare returns across different frequencies, we use annualization techniques.\n\nSo far, we have worked with daily returns, but we can easily convert our data to other frequencies. Let's create monthly returns from our daily data:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nreturns_monthly <- returns_daily |>\n  mutate(date = floor_date(date, \"month\")) |>\n  group_by(symbol, date) |>\n  summarize(\n    ret = prod(1 + ret) - 1,\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn this code, we first group the data by symbol and month and then compute monthly returns by compounding the daily returns: $(1+r_1)(1+r_2)\\ldots(1+r_n)-1$. To visualize how return characteristics change across different frequencies, we can compare histograms as in @fig-103:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\napple_returns <- bind_rows(\n  returns_daily |> \n    filter(symbol == \"AAPL\") |> \n    mutate(frequency = \"Daily\"),\n  returns_monthly |> \n    filter(symbol == \"AAPL\") |> \n    mutate(frequency = \"Monthly\")\n)\n\napple_returns |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = ret, fill = frequency)) +\n  geom_histogram(position = \"identity\", bins = 50) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    fill = \"Frequency\",\n    title = \"Distribution of Apple returns across different frequencies\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  facet_wrap(~ frequency, scales = \"free\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Returns are based on prices adjusted for dividend payments and stock splits.](working-with-stock-returns_files/figure-html/fig-103-1.png){#fig-103 fig-alt='Title: Distribution of Apple returns across different frequencies. The figure shows the distribution of daily and monthly returns in two separate facets.' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Other Forms of Data Aggregation\n\nOf course, aggregation across variables other than `symbol` or `date` can also make sense. For instance, suppose you are interested in answering questions like: Are days with high aggregate trading volume likely followed by days with high aggregate trading volume? To provide some initial analysis on this question, we take the downloaded data and compute aggregate daily trading volume for all Dow index constituents in USD. Recall that the column `volume` is denoted in the number of traded shares.\\index{Trading volume} Thus, we multiply the trading volume with the daily adjusted closing price to get a proxy for the aggregate trading volume in USD. Scaling by `1e-9` (R can handle scientific notation) denotes daily trading volume in billion USD.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrading_volume <- prices_daily |>\n  group_by(date) |>\n  summarize(trading_volume = sum(volume * adjusted_close))\n\ntrading_volume |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = trading_volume)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL, y = NULL,\n    title = \"Aggregate daily trading volume of Dow Jones index constitutens\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = unit_format(unit = \"B\", scale = 1e-9))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total daily trading volume in billion USD.](working-with-stock-returns_files/figure-html/fig-104-1.png){#fig-104 fig-alt='Title: Aggregate daily trading volume of Dow Jones index constitutens. The figure shows a volatile time series of daily trading volume, ranging from 15 in 2000 to 20.5 in 2023, with a maximum of more than 100.' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n@fig-104 indicates a clear upward trend in aggregated daily trading volume. In particular, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, markets have processed substantial trading volumes, as analyzed, for instance, by @Goldstein2021.\\index{Covid 19} One way to illustrate the persistence of trading volume would be to plot volume on day $t$ against volume on day $t-1$ as in the example below. In @fig-105, we add a dotted 45°-line to indicate a hypothetical one-to-one relation by `geom_abline()`, addressing potential differences in the axes' scales.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrading_volume |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = lag(trading_volume), y = trading_volume)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_abline(aes(intercept = 0, slope = 1),\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Previous day aggregate trading volume\",\n    y = \"Aggregate trading volume\",\n    title = \"Persistence in daily trading volume of Dow Jones index constituents\"\n  ) + \n  scale_x_continuous(labels = unit_format(unit = \"B\", scale = 1e-9)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = unit_format(unit = \"B\", scale = 1e-9))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nWarning: Removed 1 row containing missing values or values outside the scale\nrange (`geom_point()`).\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Total daily trading volume in billion USD.](working-with-stock-returns_files/figure-html/fig-105-1.png){#fig-105 fig-alt='Title: Persistence in daily trading volume of Dow Jones index constituents. The figure shows a scatterplot where aggregate trading volume and previous-day aggregate trading volume neatly line up along a 45-degree line.' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDo you understand where the warning `## Warning: Removed 1 rows containing missing values (geom_point).` comes from and what it means?\\index{Error message} Purely eye-balling reveals that days with high trading volume are often followed by similarly high trading volume days.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- You can use the `tidyverse` in R to efficiently analyze stock market data using consistent and scalable workflows.\n- The `tidyfinance` R package allows seamless downloading of historical stock prices and index data directly from Yahoo Finance.\n- Tidy data principles enable efficient analysis of financial data.\n- Adjusted stock prices provide a more accurate reflection of investor returns by accounting for dividends and stock splits.\n- Summary statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and quantiles offer insights into stock return behavior over time.\n- Visualizations created with `ggplot2` help identify trends, volatility, and return distributions in financial time series.\n- Tidy data principles make it easy to scale financial analyses from a single stock to entire indices like the Dow Jones or S&P 500.\n- Consistent workflows form the foundation for advanced financial analysis.\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.  Download daily prices for another stock market symbol of your choice from Yahoo Finance using `download_data()` from the `tidyfinance` package. Plot two time series of the symbol’s un-adjusted and adjusted closing prices. Explain any visible differences.\n2.  Compute daily net returns for an asset of your choice and visualize the distribution of daily returns in a histogram using 100 bins. Also, use `geom_vline()` to add a dashed red vertical line that indicates the 5 percent quantile of the daily returns. Compute summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) for the daily returns.\n3.  Take your code from the previous exercises and generalize it such that you can perform all the computations for an arbitrary number of symbols (e.g., `symbol <- c(\"AAPL\", \"MMM\", \"BA\")`). Automate the download, the plot of the price time series, and create a table of return summary statistics for this arbitrary number of assets.\n4.  To facilitate the computation of the annualization factor, write a function that takes a vector of return dates as input and determines the frequency before returning the appropriate annualization factor.\n5.  Are days with high aggregate trading volume often also days with large absolute returns? Find an appropriate visualization to analyze the question using the symbol `AAPL`.\n",
