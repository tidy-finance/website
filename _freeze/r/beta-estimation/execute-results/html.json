You can find the equivalent chapter for the sibling **Tidy Finance with Python** [here](../python/beta-estimation.qmd).\n:::\n\nIn this chapter, we introduce an important concept in financial economics: the exposure of an individual stock to changes in the market portfolio. According to the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) of @Sharpe1964, @Lintner1965, and @Mossin1966, cross-sectional variation in expected asset returns should be a function of the covariance between the excess return of the asset and the excess return on the market portfolio.\\index{CAPM} The regression coefficient of excess market returns on excess stock returns is usually called the market beta. We show an estimation procedure for the market betas.\\index{Beta} We do not go into details about the foundations of market beta but simply refer to any treatment of the [CAPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_asset_pricing_model) for further information. Instead, we provide details about all the functions that we use to compute the results. In particular, we leverage useful computational concepts: rolling-window estimation and parallelization.\n\nWe use the following R packages throughout this chapter:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(RSQLite)\nlibrary(scales)\nlibrary(slider)\nlibrary(furrr)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nCompared to previous chapters, we introduce `slider` [@slider] for sliding window functions, and `furrr` [@furrr] to apply mapping functions in parallel.\n\n## Estimating Beta Using Monthly Returns\n\nThe estimation procedure is based on a rolling-window estimation, where we may use either monthly or daily returns and different window lengths. First, let us start with loading the monthly CRSP data from our `SQLite`-database introduced in [Accessing and Managing Financial Data](accessing-and-managing-financial-data.qmd) and [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd).\\index{Data!CRSP}\\index{Data!Fama-French factors}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntidy_finance <- dbConnect(\n  SQLite(),\n  \"data/tidy_finance_r.sqlite\",\n  extended_types = TRUE\n)\n\ncrsp_monthly <- tbl(tidy_finance, \"crsp_monthly\") |>\n  select(permno, date, industry, ret_excess) |>\n  collect()\n\nfactors_ff3_monthly <- tbl(tidy_finance, \"factors_ff3_monthly\") |>\n  select(date, mkt_excess) |>\n  collect()\n\ncrsp_monthly <- crsp_monthly |>\n  left_join(factors_ff3_monthly, join_by(date))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nTo estimate the CAPM regression coefficients  \n$$\nr_{i, t} - r_{f, t} = \\alpha_i + \\beta_i(r_{m, t}-r_{f,t})+\\varepsilon_{i, t}\n$$\nwe regress stock excess returns `ret_excess` on excess returns of the market portfolio `mkt_excess`. R provides a simple solution to estimate (linear) models with the function `lm()`. `lm()` requires a formula as input that is specified in a compact symbolic form. An expression of the form `y ~ model` is interpreted as a specification that the response `y` is modeled by a linear predictor specified symbolically by `model`. Such a model consists of a series of terms separated by `+` operators. In addition to standard linear models, `lm()` provides a lot of flexibility. You should check out the documentation for more information. To start, we restrict the data only to the time series of observations in CRSP that correspond to Apple’s stock (i.e., to `permno` 14593 for Apple) and compute $\\hat\\alpha_i$ as well as $\\hat\\beta_i$.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfit <- lm(ret_excess ~ mkt_excess,\n  data = crsp_monthly |>\n    filter(permno == \"14593\")\n)\n\nsummary(fit)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = ret_excess ~ mkt_excess, data = filter(crsp_monthly, \n    permno == \"14593\"))\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-0.5173 -0.0563  0.0001  0.0605  0.3949 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

The output above indicates that Apple moves excessively with the market as the estimated $\\hat\\beta_i$ is above one ($\\hat\\beta_i \\approx 1.4$). \n\n## Rolling-Window Estimation\n\nAfter we estimated the regression coefficients on an example, we scale the estimation of  $\\beta_i$ to a whole different level and perform rolling-window estimations for the entire CRSP sample.\\index{Rolling-window estimation} The following function implements the CAPM regression for a data frame (or a part thereof) containing at least `min_obs` observations to avoid huge fluctuations if the time series is too short. If the condition is violated, that is, the time series is too short, the function returns a missing value. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nestimate_capm <- function(data, min_obs = 1) {\n  if (nrow(data) < min_obs) {\n    beta <- as.numeric(NA)\n  } else {\n    fit <- lm(ret_excess ~ mkt_excess, data = data)\n    beta <- as.numeric(coefficients(fit)[2])\n  }\n  return(beta)\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the `tidyfinance` package provides an `estimate_model()` function that provides more flexibility with respect to the model. \n\nNext, we define a function that does the rolling estimation. The `slide_period` function is able to handle months in its window input in a straightforward manner. We thus avoid using any time-series package (e.g., `zoo`) and converting the data to fit the package functions, but rather stay in the world of the `tidyverse`.\n\nThe following function takes input data and slides across the `date` vector, considering only a total of `months` months. The function essentially performs three steps: (i) arrange all rows, (ii) compute betas by sliding across months, and (iii) return a tibble with months and corresponding beta estimates. As we demonstrate further below, we can also apply the same function to daily returns data. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nroll_capm_estimation <- function(data, months, min_obs) {\n  data <- data |>\n    arrange(date)\n\n  betas <- slide_period_vec(\n    .x = data,\n    .i = data$date,\n    .period = \"month\",\n    .f = ~ estimate_capm(., min_obs),\n    .before = months - 1,\n    .complete = FALSE\n  )\n\n  return(tibble(\n    date = unique(data$date),\n    beta = betas\n  ))\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nBefore we attack the whole CRSP sample, let us focus on a couple of examples for well-known firms.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nexamples <- tribble(\n  ~permno, ~company,\n  14593, \"Apple\",\n  10107, \"Microsoft\",\n  93436, \"Tesla\",\n  17778, \"Berkshire Hathaway\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf we want to estimate rolling betas for Apple, we can use `mutate()`. We take a total of 5 years of data and require at least 48 months with return data to compute our betas. Check out the Exercises if you want to compute beta for different time periods. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta_example <- crsp_monthly |>\n  filter(permno == examples$permno[1]) |>\n  mutate(roll_capm_estimation(\n    pick(date, ret_excess, mkt_excess), \n    months = 60, min_obs = 48)\n  ) |>\n  drop_na()\nbeta_example\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 469 × 6\n  permno date       industry      ret_excess mkt_excess  beta\n   <dbl> <date>     <chr>              <dbl>      <dbl> <dbl>\n1  14593 1984-12-01 Manufacturing     0.170      0.0184  2.05\n2  14593 1985-01-01 Manufacturing    -0.0108     0.0799  1.90\n3  14593 1985-02-01 Manufacturing    -0.152      0.0122  1.88\n4  14593 1985-03-01 Manufacturing    -0.112     -0.0084  1.89\n5  14593 1985-04-01 Manufacturing    -0.0467    -0.0096  1.90\n# ℹ 464 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt is actually quite simple to perform the rolling-window estimation for an arbitrary number of stocks, which we visualize in the following code chunk and the resulting @fig-601. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta_examples <- crsp_monthly |>\n  inner_join(examples, join_by(permno)) |>\n  group_by(permno) |>\n  mutate(roll_capm_estimation(\n    pick(date, ret_excess, mkt_excess), \n    months = 60, min_obs = 48)\n  ) |>\n  ungroup() |>\n  select(permno, company, date, beta) |>\n  drop_na()\n\nbeta_examples |>\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = date, \n    y = beta, \n    color = company,\n    linetype = company)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL, y = NULL, color = NULL, linetype = NULL,\n    title = \"Monthly beta estimates for example stocks using 5 years of data\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The CAPM betas are estimated with monthly data and a rolling window of length 5 years based on adjusted excess returns from CRSP.

Remember that we have to perform rolling-window estimations across all stocks and time periods. However, this estimation problem is an ideal scenario to employ the power of parallelization. Parallelization means that we split the tasks which perform rolling-window estimations across different workers (or cores on your local machine). \n\nFirst, we `nest()` the data by `permno`. Nested data means we now have a list of `permno` with corresponding time series data and an `industry` label. We get one row of output for each unique combination of non-nested variables which are `permno` and `industry`.\\index{Data!Nested}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly_nested <- crsp_monthly |>\n  nest(data = c(date, ret_excess, mkt_excess))\ncrsp_monthly_nested\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 30,508 × 3\n  permno industry      data              \n   <dbl> <chr>         <list>            \n1  10000 Manufacturing <tibble [16 × 3]> \n2  10001 Utilities     <tibble [378 × 3]>\n3  10092 Services      <tibble [221 × 3]>\n4  10092 Finance       <tibble [69 × 3]> \n5  10093 Services      <tibble [49 × 3]> \n# ℹ 30,503 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could have created the same nested data by *excluding* the variables that we *do not* want to nest, as in the following code chunk. However, for many applications it is desirable to explicitly state the variables that are nested into the `data` list-column, so that the reader can track what ends up in there.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly_nested <- crsp_monthly |>\n  nest(data = -c(permno, industry))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we want to apply the `roll_capm_estimation()` function to each stock. This situation is an ideal use case for `map()`, which takes a list or vector as input and returns an object of the same length as the input. In our case, `map()` returns a single data frame with a time series of beta estimates for each stock. Therefore, we use `unnest()` to transform the list of outputs to a tidy data frame. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly_nested |>\n  inner_join(examples, join_by(permno)) |>\n  mutate(beta = map(\n    data,\n    ~ roll_capm_estimation(., months = 60, min_obs = 48)\n  )) |>\n  unnest(beta) |>\n  select(permno, date, beta_monthly = beta) |>\n  drop_na()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1,509 × 3\n  permno date       beta_monthly\n   <dbl> <date>            <dbl>\n1  10107 1990-03-01         1.39\n2  10107 1990-04-01         1.38\n3  10107 1990-05-01         1.43\n4  10107 1990-06-01         1.43\n5  10107 1990-07-01         1.45\n# ℹ 1,504 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHowever, instead, we want to perform the estimations of rolling betas for different stocks in parallel. If you have a Windows or Mac machine, it makes most sense to define `multisession`, which means that separate R processes are running in the background on the same machine to perform the individual jobs. If you check out the documentation of `plan()`, you can also see other ways to resolve the parallelization in different environments. Note that we use `availableCores()` to determine the number of cores available for parallelization, but keep one core free for other tasks. Some machines might freeze if all cores are busy with Python jobs. \\index{Parallelization}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nn_cores = availableCores() - 1\nplan(multisession, workers = n_cores)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nUsing eight cores, the estimation for our sample of around 25k stocks takes around 20 minutes. Of course, you can speed up things considerably by having more cores available to share the workload or by having more powerful cores. Notice the difference in the code below? All you need to do is to replace `map()` with `future_map()`.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta_monthly <- crsp_monthly_nested |>\n  mutate(beta = future_map(\n    data, ~roll_capm_estimation(., months = 60, min_obs = 48)\n  )) |>\n  unnest(c(beta)) |>\n  select(permno, date, beta_monthly = beta) |>\n  drop_na()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nIf you want to implement the above estimation steps using the `tidyfinance` package, then you can use the `estimate_betas()` function:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta_monthly <- crsp_monthly |>\n  estimate_betas(model = \"ret_excess ~ mkt_excess\", lookback = months(60), min_obs = 48, use_furrr = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n## Estimating Beta Using Daily Returns\n\nBefore we provide some descriptive statistics of our beta estimates, we implement the estimation for the daily CRSP sample as well. Depending on the application, you might either use longer horizon beta estimates based on monthly data or shorter horizon estimates based on daily returns. As loading the full daily CRSP data requires relatively large amounts of memory, we split the beta estimation into smaller chunks.\\index{Parallelization} The logic follows the approach that we use to download the daily CRSP data (see [WRDS, CRSP, and Compustat](wrds-crsp-and-compustat.qmd)).\n\nFirst, we load the daily Fama-French market excess returns.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfactors_ff3_daily <- tbl(tidy_finance, \"factors_ff3_daily\") |>\n  select(date, mkt_excess) |>\n  collect()\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe then create a connection to the daily CRSP data in our database, but we don't load the whole table into our memory. We only extract all distinct `permno` because we loop the beta estimation over batches of stocks. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrsp_daily_db <- tbl(tidy_finance, \"crsp_daily\")\n\npermnos <- crsp_daily_db |>\n  distinct(permno) |> \n  pull(permno)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFor the daily data, we consider around three months of data, require at least 48 observations, and estimate betas in batches of 500.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbatch_size <- 500\nbatches <- ceiling(length(permnos) / batch_size)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nWe then proceed to perform the same steps as with the monthly CRSP data, just in batches: Load in daily returns, nest the data by stock, and parallelize the beta estimation across stocks. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbeta_daily <- list()\nfor (j in 1:batches) {\n  \n  permno_batch <- permnos[\n    ((j - 1) * batch_size + 1):min(j * batch_size, length(permnos))\n  ]\n  \n  crsp_daily_sub <- crsp_daily_db |> \n    filter(permno %in% permno_batch) |> \n    select(permno, date, ret_excess) |> \n    collect()\n  \n  crsp_daily_sub_nested <- crsp_daily_sub |> \n    inner_join(factors_ff3_daily, join_by(date)) |> \n    mutate(date = floor_date(date, \"month\")) |> \n    nest(data = c(date, ret_excess, mkt_excess)) \n \n  beta_daily[[j]]  <- crsp_daily_sub_nested |> \n    mutate(beta_daily = future_map(\n      data, ~roll_capm_estimation(., months = 3, min_obs = 48)\n    )) |>\n    unnest(c(beta_daily)) |>\n    select(permno, date, beta_daily = beta) |>\n    drop_na()\n \n  message(\"Batch \", j, \" out of \", batches, \" done (\", percent(j / batches), \")\\n\")\n  \n}\nbeta_daily <- bind_rows(beta_daily)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nYou can also use the `estimate_betas()` function from the `tidyfinance` package to estimate betas based on daily data. Please consult the corresponding documentation and exercise below. \n\n## Comparing Beta Estimates\n\nWhat is a typical value for stock betas? To get some feeling, we illustrate the dispersion of the estimated $\\hat\\beta_i$ across different industries and across time below. @fig-602 shows that typical business models across industries imply different exposure to the general market economy. However, there are barely any firms that exhibit a negative exposure to the market factor.\\index{Graph!Box plot}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncrsp_monthly |>\n  left_join(beta_monthly, join_by(permno, date)) |>\n  drop_na(beta_monthly) |>\n  group_by(industry, permno) |>\n  summarize(beta = mean(beta_monthly), \n            .groups = \"drop\") |>\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(industry, beta, FUN = median), y = beta)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL, y = NULL,\n    title = \"Firm-specific beta distributions by industry\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The box plots show the average firm-specific beta estimates by industry.](beta-estimation_files/figure-html/fig-602-1.png){#fig-602 fig-alt='Title: Firm-specific beta distributions by industry.

Second, the sample exhibits periods where the dispersion across stocks increases in the sense that the lower decile decreases and the upper decile increases, which indicates that for some stocks the correlation with the market increases while for others it decreases.

In the subsequent chapters, we mainly use the estimates based on monthly data, as most readers should be able to replicate them due to potential memory limitations that might arise with the daily data. \n\n## Exercises\n\n1. Compute beta estimates based on monthly data using one, three, and five years of data and impose a minimum number of observations of 10, 28, and 48 months with return data, respectively. How strongly correlated are the estimated betas?\n1. Compute beta estimates based on monthly data using five years of data and impose different numbers of minimum observations. How does the share of `permno`-`date` observations with successful beta estimates vary across the different requirements? Do you find a high correlation across the estimated betas? \n1. Instead of using `future_map()`, perform the beta estimation in a loop (using either monthly or daily data) for a subset of 100 permnos of your choice. Verify that you get the same results as with the parallelized code from above.\n1. Filter out the stocks with negative betas. Do these stocks frequently exhibit negative betas, or do they resemble estimation errors? \n1. Compute beta estimates for multi-factor models such as the Fama-French three-factor model. For that purpose, you extend your regression to \n$$\nr_{i, t} - r_{f, t} = \\alpha_i + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^k\\beta_{i,k}(r_{j, t}-r_{f,t})+\\varepsilon_{i, t}\n$${#eq-multi-factor}\nwhere $r_{i, t}$ are the $k$ factor returns. Thus, you estimate four parameters ($\\alpha_i$ and the slope coefficients). Provide some summary statistics of the cross-section of firms and their exposure to the different factors.\n1. Estimate market betas based on daily CRSP using the `estimate_betas()` function from the `tidyfinance` package. Note that a memory-efficient way is to adjust the loop that we use above to handle daily CRSP data. ",
